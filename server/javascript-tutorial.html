                    JavaScript is a popular programming language used in web development. It adds interactivity and
                    dynamic content to websites. As a beginner, learning JavaScript can empower you to create
                    interactive buttons, forms, and animations. It's essential to grasp fundamental concepts like
                    variables, functions, and conditions to start building exciting web projects.

                    </summary>

                    In JavaScript, variables are like containers that hold data. They allow us to store and manipulate
                    information, such as numbers, text, or objects. To create a variable, we use the 'let' or 'const'
                    keyword, followed by a name. We can change the value of a variable anytime, making it flexible for
                    coding tasks. For example:
                    <pre><div>JavaScript</div><div></div></pre>
                    <p>
                        Here's some keywords to declare a variable
                        <br><br>
                        <b>var</b> :"If you using this keyword to declare a variable then the variable can easily be
                        reclared and change it's data" (note: this keyword to declare a variable is used in very old
                        code
                        and nowadays no-one really uses it try using other keywords to declare a variable)
                        <br><br>
                        <b>let</b> :"Using this keyword the variables can't be re-declared but something can be added
                        after
                        words using this code:-`variable = value` " (recommended)
                        <br><br>
                        <b>const</b> :"If you declare a variable using this keyword then there's no way possible way to
                        change it's data once declared, and yes you can transfer it's data to a variable which can maybe
                        re-declared but the the variable declared using this keyword will not effected at all"
                        <br><br>
                        (note: You can't use any numbers at beginning of the name the variable without a string and you
                        also
                        can't even use any preserved keywords of JavaScript)

                    <p>If some code is inside a bracket then it won't affect anything outside of it. it works like a
                        different function by itself and this applies to every type of brackets means you can declare
                        unre-declareable variables inside a bracket except variables which is declared using 'var'
                        keyword
                        cause if it's declared inside a bracket and it'll also work outside the bracket</p>
