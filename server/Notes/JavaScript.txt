Introduction
	
	JavaScript is a popular programming language used in web development. It adds interactivity and dynamic content to websites. As a beginner, learning JavaScript can empower you to create interactive buttons, forms, and animations. It's essential to grasp fundamental concepts like variables, functions, and conditions to start building exciting web projects.
	
	Some topics may not be fully explored in here so Consider Checking The MDN reference for Extra Details: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

Section: Node.js

1. Variables

	In JavaScript, variables are like containers that hold data. They allow us to store and manipulate information, such as numbers, text, or objects. To create a variable, we use the 'let' or 'const' keyword, followed by a name. We can change the value of a variable anytime, making it flexible for coding tasks. For example:
		JS:`
		
		let age = 25; // A variable named 'age' with the value 25
		const name = "John"; // A constant variable named 'name' with the value "John"

		`

	Here's some keywords to declare a variable

	(i) var :"If you using this keyword to declare a variable then the variable can easily be reclared and change it's data" (note: this keyword to declare a variable is used in very old code and nowadays no-one really uses it try using other keywords to declare a variable)

	(ii) let :"Using this keyword the variables can't be re-declared but something can be added after words using this code:-`variable = value` " (recommended)
	
	(iii) const :"If you declare a variable using this keyword then there's no way possible way to change it's data once declared, and yes you can transfer it's data to a variable which can maybe re-declared but the the variable declared using this keyword will not effected at all"
	
	(note: You can't use any numbers at beginning of the name the variable without a string and you also can't even use any preserved keywords of JavaScript)

2. Bracket
	
	(i) If some code is inside a bracket then it won't affect anything outside of it. it works like a different function by itself and this applies to every type of brackets means you can declare unre-declareable variables inside a bracket except variables which is declared using 'var' keyword cause if it's declared inside a bracket and it'll also work outside the bracket

	(ii) something like this for example:-

	{
		let variable = "Data"
		console.log(variable)
	}
	
3. Data Types 

	(i) Primitive Data Types: There are Total 7 Primitive Data Types
		Here's List of Primitive Data Types

		(a) "Null" Nothing
		(b) "Number" A Whole Number
		(c) "BigInt"
		(d) "Booleon" it's value can be `true` and `false`
		(e) "String" Contains Text of Your Choice
	
			(I) String is used to store chunks of text
			(II) String can be used by Sets of:- 
				
				(A) Double Quotes("text") 
				(B) Single Quotes('text') 
				(C) Template literal" ` "

					I. Syntax: Template literals use backticks to enclose the string content. For example:-

						const name = "Alice";
						const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;

					II. Embedded Expressions: One of the primary advantages of template literals is the ability to embed expressions within the string using ${}. These expressions are evaluated, and their results are inserted into the string.

						const x = 10;
						const y = 20;
						const sum = `The sum of ${x} and ${y} is ${x + y}.`;

					III. Multiline Strings: Template literals make it easy to create multiline strings without needing to include explicit line breaks or concatenation. You can simply press Enter within the backticks to create new lines:

						const multiline = `
						This is a
						multiline string
						created with
						template literals.
						`;

					IV. Escaping Backticks: To include an actual backtick character within a template literal, you can escape it with a backslash (\). For example:-

						const textWithBacktick = `This is a backtick: \` inside a template literal.`;

					V. Expression Evaluation: Expressions within ${} are evaluated, so you can include any valid JavaScript expression. This allows for complex calculations, function calls, or even conditional logic within template literals.

						const value = 5;
						const squared = `The square of ${value} is ${value ** 2}.`;

					VI. Tagged Templates (Advanced): Template literals can also be used with a tag function, which allows you to process the template literal's contents using a custom function. This advanced feature is useful for tasks like internationalization, escaping, or custom formatting of strings.

						function customTag(strings, ...values) {
						    // Custom processing of strings and values
						}
						const result = customTag`This is a ${value}.`;
						
			(III) `String.length` Gives The length of the String			
			(VI) A backslash(\) right before a letter inside The String Makes the System Consider The Letter as a Text. for Example:-

				let a = 'What\'s this?'
				console.log(a) // Prints: What's this

				(Note: backslash(\) itself will not be include in the string, it requires another blackslah to display one.)

			(VII) `String.toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` makes all of the characters in The String Lowercase and Uppercase
			(VIII) `String.slice()` function extract a portion of a string or an array and creates a new one. It takes one or two arguments: the starting and ending index (the ending index is optional). The function returns a new string or array containing the elements from the original that fall within the specified range.

				const text = "Hello, World!";
				const sliced = text.slice(0, 5); // Extracts "Hello"

				(Note: It takes Index and It starts from '0' instead of '1')
			(IX) `String.replace("Text", "Your text")` checks the avariable for a match with the first argument and if it finds one then it replaces it with the second argument.
			(X) `String.concat(variable1 , variable2);` Combines 2 Strings together.
			(XI) `String.trim("your Text")` Removes The specific Text that you've defined, From the String in the Variable 
			(XII) `String.includes("fox")` checks for a match in the variable and if it finds one then returns a boolean
			(XIII) `String.substr()` returns a portion of this string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.

				const str = 'Mozilla';
				console.log(str.substr(1, 2));
				// Expected output: "oz"

				console.log(str.substr(2));
				// Expected output: "zilla"

				(Note: `substr()` is not part of the main ECMAScript specification â€” it's defined in Annex B: Additional ECMAScript Features for Web Browsers, which is normative optional for non-browser runtimes. Therefore, people are advised to use the standard `String.substring()` and `String.slice()` methods instead to make their code maximally cross-platform friendly. The `String.substring()` page has some comparisons between the three methods.)
		(VI) "Symbol" ( A Symbol)
		(VII) "Undefined" ( Undefined can be used something like this "(const,let,var) (variable)" or "(const,let,var) (variable) = undefined")
			
	(ii) Non-primitive Data Types

		(a) Non-primitive Data Types are "Objects"
		(b) Objects are Key Value Pairs
		for example :-
			
			const player = {
				"Key": "Value",
				level: 79,
				kills: 5435,
				money: 1000,
				vip: false,
				Duration: 2345
			}
			
		(c) even if you declared this using 'const', it's change through this code below here
		(d) to add or change a key value pair to the Object type "Variable['Key']" = Value"
	
4. Console.log Function
	
	(i) to print something in the output it can be used by typing this "console.log"
	(ii) add closed round brackets in front of it (without space)
	(iii) put the name of the variable in the round brackets, It'll look something like this "console.log(variable)"
	(iv) If you want to add multiple variable then put a space and add a plus("+") sign and then a space then type the variable name you can do this many times as you want and also you can also put strings number too. 
	(v) You can also use any arithmetic operators or Assignment Operator (They are list below in Section 5),  but make sure that the data inside all of the variable is a number not anything else only for the ones you're using
	(vi) If you want to know what is the type of the variable then do "console.log(typeof variable)", It will print the type of the variable in the Output
	(vii) to look up for something in JavaScript type this "console.log(variable['key'])" it can also be done by "console.log(variable.key)" if the key is not a string, It will Show The Value of The Key in The Object
	
5. Operators and Expressions
	
	(i) To do the Basic Mathematics Operands and Operators are used in it
	(ii) Operands are The Numbers that are going to be used
	(iii) Operators are the keys like division, multiplication, subtraction, or addition
	
	(iv) Arithmetic Operators
		
		(a) `+` Addition: The `+` operator is used for addition.
			
			(I) It adds numeric values or concatenates strings. When used with strings, it concatenates the second string to the end of the first string. For example, 2 + 3 returns 5, and "Hello" + " " + "World" returns "Hello World".
		(b) `-` Subtraction: The `-` operator subtracts the second operand from the first.
			
			(I) It can be used with numeric values. For example, 5 - 3 returns 2.
		(c) `*` Multiplication: The `*` operator multiplies the operands.
			
			(I) It is used to multiply numeric values. For example, 2 * 3 returns 6.
		(d) `/` Division: The `/` operator divides the first operand by the second.
			
			(I) It is used to perform division operations on numeric values. For example, 6 / 2 returns 3.
		(e) `%` Modulus: The `%` operator returns the division remainder.
			
			(I) It is used to find the remainder after division. For example, 5 % 2 returns 1.
		(f) `++` Increment: The `++` operator increments the numeric value by one.
			
			(I) It can be used as a prefix or postfix operator. For example, let a = 5; a++; would result in a being 6.
		(g) `--` Decrement: The -- operator decreases the numeric value by one.
			
			(I) It can be used as a prefix or postfix operator. For example, let b = 5; b--; would result in b being 4.
	
	(v) Assignment operators

		(a) `=` Assignment Operator: The `=` operator assigns a value to a variable.
			
			(I) It is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. For example, x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

		(b) `+=` Addition Assignment: The `+=` operator adds the value on the right to the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
			
			(I) For example, x += 3 is the same as x = x + 3.

		(c) `-=` Subtraction Assignment: The `-=` operator subtracts the value on the right from the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
			
			(I) For example, x -= 3 is the same as x = x - 3.

		(d) `*=` Multiplication Assignment: The `*=` operator multiplies the variable by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
			
			(I) For example, x *= 3 is the same as x = x * 3.

		(e) `/=` Division Assignment: The `/=` operator divides the variable by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
			
			(I) For example, x /= 3 is the same as x = x / 3.

		(f) `%=` Modulus Assignment: The `%=` operator performs modulus division on the variable and the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
			
			(I) For example, x %= 3 is the same as x = x % 3.
	
	(vi) Comparison Operators
		
		List of Comparison Operators:

		(a) `==` Equality Operator: The `==` operator compares the equality of two operands after converting them to the same type.

			(I) It returns true if the operands are equal. For example, 5 == '5' evaluates to true.
		(b) `===` Strict Equality Operator: The `===` operator checks for both value and type equality.
			
			(I) It returns true only if the operands are of the same type and have the same value. For example, 5 === 5 evaluates to true, but 5 === '5' evaluates to false.
		(c) `!=` Inequality Operator: The `!=` operator checks if two operands are not equal.
			
			(I) It returns true if the operands are not equal and false if they are. For example, 5 != 3 evaluates to true.
		(d) `!==` Strict Inequality Operator: The `!==` operator checks for both value and type inequality.
			
			(I) It returns true if the operands are of different types or have different values. For example, 5 !== '5' evaluates to true, but 5 !== 5 evaluates to false.
		(e) `>` Greater Than Operator: The `>` operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
			
			(I) It returns true if the left operand is greater, and false otherwise. For example, 5 > 3 evaluates to true.
		(f) `<` Less Than Operator: The `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
			
			(I) It returns true if the left operand is less, and false otherwise. For example, 5 < 3 evaluates to false.
		(g) `>=` Greater Than or Equal Operator: The `>=` operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
			
			(I) It returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal, and false otherwise. For example, 5 >= 5 evaluates to true.
		(h) `<=` Less Than or Equal Operator: The `<=` operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
			
			(I) It returns true if the left operand is less than or equal, and false otherwise. For example, 5 <= 3 evaluates to false.
		(i) `?` Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is a conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on the result of the evaluation.
			
			(I) It has the syntax condition ? value if true : value if false. For example, let result = (x > 0) ? "positive" : "non-positive"; assigns "positive" to the variable result if x is greater than 0, and "non-positive" otherwise. This operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional statements in JavaScript.
		
	(vii) Logical Operators
		
		list of Logical Operators:

		(a) `&&` Logical AND: The logical AND operator returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns false. For example, let result = (x < 5 && y < 10); returns true if both x is less than 5 and y is less than 10.

		(b) `||` Logical OR: The logical OR operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true; it returns false if both operands are false. For instance, let result = (x < 5 || y < 10); returns true if either x is less than 5 or y is less than 10.

		(c) `!` Logical NOT: The logical NOT operator reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, the NOT operator makes it false, and vice versa. For example, let result = !(x < 5); returns true if x is not less than 5.

6. Comments

	(Note: Comment is a text in the Code which is Ingored by the Programm it can be used to navigate around you code)
	(i) To Comment any Text in the code put double slash at the very beginning of the line, something like this "//"
	(ii) if you're in VS Code then just select of any text of the line which you want to be commented and hold Control and hit slash (Ctrl + /)
	(iii) to Comment out text in which is Distributed in many lines put slash and a star "/*" at the very beginning of the line and then now come to very end of the last line now put a star and a slash "*/", every text on that area will be commented

7. Conditional Expressions

	(i) If Statements

		(a) "If" is used to run code with conditions for example if you use prompt with it and if a user has put a number into it will run the code according to it,for example if the user has put 4 then it will the first code or the user has put a different number then the code line of 2 will run
		(b) for example :-

			If(variable=1){
				alert("This is The First code")
			}
			If(variable=2){
				alert("This is The Second code")
			}
			
		(c) if you add "else if" statement after the "If" statement, if the test fails with 'if' statement then it'll check for a match in it, and also you can add them much as you want
		(d) if you add "else" in after the "If or else if" statement then if all the test fails then It'll run
		(d) The Code will look something like this:-
		
			let age =  prompt("What\'s Your Age?")
			age = Number.parseInt(age);
			if(age>18 && age<=100){
				alert("You\'re an Adult ")
			}
			else if(age<=18 && age>=13){
				alert("You\'re a Teenager")
			}
			else if(age<13 && age>=4){
				alert("You\'re a Kid")
			}
			else if(age<4 && age>0){
				alert("You\'re still a Baby")
			}
			else{
				alert("Invalid age")
			}

		(note: Do Not Put a Semicolumn";" after the if statement if you want to use else, but you can still use it inside the brackets)
		
	(ii) Statements of Switch

		(a) `switch` is a Keyword which allows you to execute some code if value of a variable matches and you have to provide it the variable.
		(b) it uses `case` keyword to compare the provided value with the variable, and then case and the code that should run is seperated a column (":"), and it works like `if` and `else if` statement.
		(c) `default` keyword working like `else` keyword means that it'll run the code if all of statements fails

		for Example:-
			
			let age = prompt("Hey What's your age?");
			age = Number.parseInt(age);
			switch(age){
			  case 19:
				alert("You're 19")
				break
			  case 20:
				alert("You're 20")
				break
			  default:
				alert("Wow You're A Proper Adult now")
				break
			}

8. Index
	
	(i) "index" typically refers to the position or numeric identifier used to access elements in an ordered collection, such as an array or a string. Understanding how indexing works in different contexts is important for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Here's an explanation of indexing in JavaScript:

	(ii) String Indexing:

		(a) Strings are sequences of characters, and you can access individual characters in a string using numeric indices.
		You can access array elements by specifying the index within square brackets, like `string[index]`.

			const text = "Hello, World!";
			const firstCharacter = text[0]; // "H"

		(b) Strings are immutable in JavaScript, meaning you cannot directly change a character at a specific index. You need to create a new string with the desired modifications.

	(iii) Array Indexing:

		(a) Arrays are ordered collections of elements, and each element has a numeric index. The index starts at 0 for the first element, 1 for the second element, and so on.

			const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
			const secondFruit = fruits[1]; // "banana"
		
		(b) Be cautious when using array indices to avoid accessing elements that do not exist, which can lead to errors.

	(iv) Object Indexing (Property Access): 
		
		(a) In objects, properties can be accessed using keys, which are often strings, but they can also be symbols. These keys act as "indexes" for accessing object properties.
		
			const person = {
			    firstName: "John",
			    lastName: "Doe",
			};
			const firstName = person.firstName; // "John"

		(b) You can also use bracket notation to access object properties using a variable or an expression as the key.

			const key = "firstName";
			const value = person[key]; // "John"

	(v) Negative Indexing (Array Only):

		(a) In JavaScript arrays, you can use negative indices to count from the end of the array. `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second-to-last, and so on.

			const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
			const lastNumber = numbers[-1]; // Gives: 50
			
		(b) Negative indexing is a convenient way to access elements from the end of an array without needing to know its length.

9. Loops

	(i) For Loops

		(a) To make a simple loop first type "for" and then without a space put a round bracked and a curly bracket in the round bracket type "let variable = 0;"(It will Create a Variable) now put a space and then type "variable <= 5;"(It will check whether the condition is true or not and it's customizeable) and then again a space and type "variable++" now come to the curly bracket and then hit enter and type "console.log(variable)" it'll will print all the number in between 0 to 5 inculding themselves
		(b) Here's The Code that let's you choose both of the value's :-
			
			let num1 = prompt("Print Numbers From: ");
			num1 = Number.parseInt(num1);

			for(let num2 = prompt("Print Numbers To: "); num1<=num2; num1++){
			  console.log(num1)
			}
			
		(c) If maded an object variable and then you want to know how many keys or strings are in there here's the code to do it
			
			let score = {
			  "player1": 89,
			  "player2": 76,
			  "player3": 54,
			  "player4": 84,
			  "player5": 91
			};
			for(let i = 0; i < Object.keys(score).length; i++){
			  console.log("Score of " + Object.keys(score)[i] + " are " + Object.values(score)[i])
			}
			
			(note: if you just replace everything the in the round bracket which is after the "console.log" to just "test +1" it will print the amount of keys in it)
			
		(d) If you put "Object.keys(score)[test]" it will print the keys and if you put "score[Object.keys(score)[test]]" it will print the values of the keys:-
		
	(ii) For in Loops

		(a) For in Loops can be used to display Value of Objects for example:- 
		
			let object = {
			  player1: 87,
			  player2: 56,
			  player3: 43,
			  player4: 67,
			  player5: 96
			}
			for(let item in object){
			  console.log("Score of " + item + " is " + object[item])
			}
			
			(note: This is the better and improved version of displaying keys and values)

	(iii) For of Loops

		(a)  If you Want to Display Each letter in a different line here's the code to do it
			
			for(let variable of "Your Text"){
			  console.log(variable)
			}
			
	(iv) While Loops
		
		(a) While Loop is almost the same as For Loops but their Syntax is a Bit Different
		(b) If You want to print the numbers from a specific value to another value here's the code to do it:-

			let num1 = prompt("Print Numbers From: ");
			num1 = Number.parseInt(num1);
			let num2 = prompt("Print Numbers To: ");
			num2 = Number.parseInt(num2);

			while(num1<=num2){
			  console.log(num1);
			  num1++;
			};
			
			(WARNING: DO NOT TRY TO MAKE ANY CHANGES THAT CAN STOP THE CONDITION TO BE BECOMING FALSE IT CAN CRASH YOUR PC)
		
		(c) If you want to make the user to enter a specific number unless it'll won't stop asking for the number, here's the code for it:-
		
			let error101 = "Error: 101, Try Again!"
			let correct_number = 4;
			let prompt_asker
			while(prompt_asker != correct_number){
				prompt_asker = prompt("Enter The Right Number")
				if(prompt_asker != correct_number){
					console.log(error101)
				}
				else{
					console.log("Success, You have entered The Correct Number")
				};
			}
			
	(v) Do While Loops

		(a) Do While Loops is a Variant of While loop but it runs the code first and then checks the condition and even if the condition is false it will atleast run once and if the condition is true then it will run again and check
		(b) here's the code ot use it:-
			
			do{
			  console.log(num1);
			  num1++;
			}while(num1<=num2);
			
10. Funtions

	(i) Functions in JavaScript, often referred to as "traditional functions" or "function expressions," are a fundamental part of the language. They are used to define reusable blocks of code that can be executed when called. Function is a Block of code that is designed to perform a particular task, it can be used for code lines that are repeated, if you use this you just need to type the name of the funtion and round brackets with the variable'same

	Let's Begin

	(ii) JavaScript functions have the following basic components:

		(a) `Function Declaration`:

			function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    			// Function body
    			// Code to be executed
			}

			(I) `functionName`: The name of the function. It's optional for anonymous functions (function expressions).
			
			(II) `parameter1, parameter2`: The parameters (inputs) that the function can accept. Parameters are optional, and you can have zero or more of them.

		(b) `Function Body`:

			(I) `the function body`, you write the code that the function will execute when it's called. You can perform calculations, manipulate data, and perform various tasks within the function.

				function add(a, b) {
    				return a + b;
				}

		(c) `Return Statement`

			(I) The return statement is used to specify the value that the function will produce as its result. If a function doesn't have a return statement, it will return undefined by default. A function can have multiple return statements, but once a return statement is executed, the function exits, and no further code within the function is executed.

				function add(a, b) {
    				return a + b;
				}

		(d) `Function Invocation (Calling)`:

			(I) To execute a function, you "call" it by using its name followed by parentheses containing the arguments (actual values) for its parameters (if any).

				function add(a, b) {
    				return a + b;
				}

				let result = add(3, 4);

			In this example, the add function is called with 3 and 4 as arguments, and it returns 7, which is assigned to the variable result.

		(e) Function Scope:
			
			(I) JavaScript functions have their own scope. Variables declared inside a function are local to that function and are not accessible outside of it unless explicitly returned.

				function exampleScope() {
				    let localVar = "I'm local!";
				    console.log(localVar); // Output: "I'm local!"
				}
				
				console.log(localVar); // Throws an error because localVar is not defined in this scope

	(iii) Arrow Functions

		(a) Arrow functions are commonly used for functions that don't require their own "this" context and are often used for callback functions, short anonymous functions, or simple one-liners.

			Here's the basic syntax of an arrow function:

			const functionName = (parameters) => {
    			// Function body
    			return result;
			};

		(b) `functionName`: The name of the function (optional). Arrow functions can be anonymous, or you can assign them to a variable as shown in the example.
		(c) `parameters`: The list of parameters the function accepts. If there's only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses around it.
		(d) `=>`: The arrow operator separates the parameter list from the function body.
		(e) `function body`: The code that gets executed when the function is called.
		(f) `result`: The value that gets returned from the function (optional). If the function body consists of a single expression, this expression's result will be returned automatically without needing an explicit return statement.

		Here are some examples to illustrate arrow functions:
		
		(g) A basic arrow function without parameters:

			const sayHello = () => {
    			console.log("Hello, World!");
			};
			
			sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello, World!

		(h) An arrow function with a single parameter:

			const square = (x) => {
    			return x * x;
			};

			console.log(square(5)); // Outputs: 25

		(i) An arrow function with a single expression (return statement is not required):

			const double = (x) => x * 2;
			console.log(double(4)); // Outputs: 8
			
		(j) Arrow functions in array methods like `map`:

			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
			const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((x) => x * x);
			console.log(squaredNumbers); // Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

		(k) Using arrow functions as callback functions:

			const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
			const nameLengths = names.map((name) => name.length);
			console.log(nameLengths); // Outputs: [5, 3, 7]

		(l) It's important to note that arrow functions have some differences compared to traditional function expressions:

			(I) Arrow functions do not have their own "this" context. They inherit the "this" value from their containing (enclosing) function or context. This behavior can be advantageous in certain situations but can also lead to unexpected results if not understood correctly.
			(II) Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors to create objects.			
			(III) Arrow functions are generally more concise and have a shorter syntax, which can make your code cleaner and easier to read for simple functions. However, for more complex functions or when you need access to the "this" context, traditional function expressions are still useful.

			(IV) `getDay()`: Returns the day of the week (0-6) for the specified date according to local time.
			(V) `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, `getSeconds()`, `getMilliseconds()`: Returns the respective components of the time.

		(d) Formatting Dates:

			(I) `toDateString()`: Converts the date portion of a `Date` object into a readable string.
			(II) `toTimeString()`: Converts the time portion of a `Date` object into a readable string.

		(e) Parsing and Conversion:

			(I) `Date.parse()`: Parses a string representation of a date and returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
			(II) `toISOString()`: Returns a string in simplified extended ISO format.

		(f) Manipulating Dates:

			(I) `setFullYear()`, `setMonth()`, `setDate()`: Sets the respective components of the date.
			(II) `setHours()`, `setMinutes()`, `setSeconds()`, `setMilliseconds()`: Sets the respective components of the time.

			(I) `getTime()`: Returns the number of milliseconds between January 1, 1970, and the specified date.
			(II) `setTime()`: Sets the Date object to the time represented by a number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

		(h) Examples:-

			(I) Creating a `Date` object and retrieving various components:

				const currentDate = new Date();

				currentDate.getFullYear(); // Current year
				currentDate.getMonth(); // Current month (0-11)
				currentDate.getDate(); // Current day of the month
				currentDate.getDay(); // Current day of the week (0-6)
				currentDate.getHours(); // Current hour
				currentDate.getMinutes(); // Current minute
				currentDate.getSeconds(); // Current second

			(II) Formatting and parsing dates:

				const dateString = currentDate.toDateString();
				const timeString = currentDate.toTimeString();
				
				console.log(dateString); // Convert date portion to a string
				console.log(timeString); // Convert time portion to a string
				
				const parsedDate = Date.parse('Aug 9, 1995');
				console.log(parsedDate); // Number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970
				
			(III) Manipulating dates:

				currentDate.setFullYear(2022); // Set year to 2022
				currentDate.setMonth(10); // Set month to November (zero-based)
				currentDate.setDate(15); // Set day of the month to 15

				currentDate.setHours(12); // Set hour to 12
				currentDate.setMinutes(30); // Set minute to 30
				currentDate.setSeconds(45); // Set second to 45

				console.log(currentDate.toDateString()); // Display the updated date
				console.log(currentDate.toTimeString()); // Display the updated time

			(IV) Date arithmetic:

				const milliseconds = currentDate.getTime(); // Number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970
				console.log(milliseconds);

				const futureDate = new Date();
				futureDate.setTime(milliseconds + 86400000); // Add 1 day (in milliseconds) to the current date
				
				console.log(futureDate.toDateString());

	(xiv) `Prompt/Alert/Confirm` Functions:

		(a) `prompt(message, defaultValue)` :"It's used to display a dialog box that prompts the user to enter some input. It takes two arguments:-

			(I) message: The message to display to the user, typically instructing them on what to enter.
			(II) DefaultValue (optional): The default value pre-filled in the input field.

			for example:

				let userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:", "John Doe");

				(A) In this example, a dialog box will appear with the message "Please enter your name:" and an input field pre-filled with "John Doe." The user can enter their name, and the input will be stored in the userInput variable.

			(III) `prompt()` returns the text entered by the user as a string or null if the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the dialog.

		(b) `alert(message)` :"alert() is used to display a simple message to the user in a dialog box. It typically contains an "OK" button to close the dialog." for example:-

	(xv) Timeout Functions

		(a) `setTimeout()`: This function executes a specified function or a specified piece of code 'ONCE' after a specified delay. It takes two main arguments: a function or a piece of code to execute and the delay time in milliseconds before the execution. Optionally, it can take additional arguments that will be passed to the function. for Example:-

			let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
			    console.log('Delayed log after 2 seconds');
			}, 2000);
			console.log(timeoutID) // Returns The ID of The Timeout which is essential to Terminate Timeouts later on

			Addition Arguments Example:-

		(b) `setInterval()`: This function 'REPEATEDLY' executes a specified function or a specified piece of code at a specified time interval. It also takes two main arguments: a function or a piece of code to execute and the time interval in milliseconds between each execution. Like `setTimeout()`, it can also take additional arguments.

			let count = 0;

			let intervalTimeoutID = setInterval(() => {

			    count++;
			    console.log('Interval log:', count);

			    if (count >= 5) {
			        clearInterval(intervalTimeoutID); // Stop the interval after 5 executions
			    }

			}, 1000);

			console.log(intervalTimeoutID)

		(c) You can Terminate any scheduled timeout by using `clearTimeout()` and `clearInterval()`, respectively and They requires ID of the Timeout which is stored inside the variable which is running the Timeout.

		(Note: The variable which is running The Timeout Function contains The ID of The Timeout)
	
11. Arrays
	
	(note: Array is an not a primitive data type it's an Object)
	(i) Array are Object's that can Hold more than 1 value
	(ii) This is an array, It can be used by using square brackets

		let a = [87, 76, 96, 67, 98];

	(iii) To Extract a specific value type "console.log(a[0])", it'll print the first value which is in the array, (note:The Number which is inside the curly bracket is an index which start from "0")
	(iv) If you type "console.log(a.length)" then it'll print the amount of elements that are in the variable
	(iv) To add a new value to the array type "a[index] = value", or just put the index of an existing one to change the value
	(v) Array Functions
	
		(a) `Array.length` returns amount of values in the array
		(b) `Array.toString()` returns array as a String			
		(c) `Array.join()` returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in this array, separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.
		(d) `Arrat.pop()` method of Array instances removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.

			const plants = ['broccoli', 'cauliflower', 'cabbage', 'kale', 'tomato'];

			console.log(plants.pop());
			// Expected output: "tomato"

			console.log(plants);
			// Expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage", "kale"]

			plants.pop();

			console.log(plants);
			// Expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage"]

		(e) `Array.push("value")` adds the specified elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

			const animals = ['pigs', 'goats', 'sheep'];

			const count = animals.push('cows');
			console.log(count);
			// Expected output: 4
			console.log(animals);
			// Expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows"]

			animals.push('chickens', 'cats', 'dogs');
			console.log(animals);
			// Expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows", "chickens", "cats", "dogs"]

		(f) `Array.concat(array1)` merges two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.

			const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
			const array2 = ['d', 'e', 'f'];
			const array3 = array1.concat(array2);

			console.log(array3);
			// Expected output: Array ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

		(g) `Array.sort()` method of Array instances sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values. 

			const months = ['March', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Dec'];
			months.sort();
			console.log(months);
			// Expected output: Array ["Dec", "Feb", "Jan", "March"]

			const array1 = [1, 30, 4, 21, 100000];
			array1.sort();
			console.log(array1);
			// Expected output: Array [1, 100000, 21, 30, 4]
		
		(h) `Array.reverse()` method of Array instances reverses an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, the first array element now becoming the last, and the last array element becoming the first. In other words, elements order in the array will be turned towards the direction opposite to that previously stated.

			const array1 = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
			console.log('array1:', array1);
			// Expected output: "array1:" Array ["one", "two", "three"]

			const reversed = array1.reverse();
			console.log('reversed:', reversed);
			// Expected output: "reversed:" Array ["three", "two", "one"]

			// Careful: reverse is destructive -- it changes the original array.
			console.log('array1:', array1);
			// Expected output: "array1:" Array ["three", "two", "one"]

		(k) `Array.slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
			
			const animals = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant'];

			console.log(animals.slice(2));
			// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck", "elephant"]

			console.log(animals.slice(2, 4));
			// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]

			console.log(animals.slice(1, 5));
			// Expected output: Array ["bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"]

			console.log(animals.slice(-2));
			// Expected output: Array ["duck", "elephant"]

			console.log(animals.slice(2, -1));
			// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]

			console.log(animals.slice());
			// Expected output: Array ["ant", "bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"]

			(I) You can also provide arguments after the 2nd argument to replace the selected items inside the array with the values of the arguments after the 2nd second argument
			
		(l) `Array.from()` static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an iterable or array-like object.

			console.log(Array.from('foo'));
			// Expected output: Array ["f", "o", "o"]

			console.log(Array.from([1, 2, 3], (x) => {
				x + x
			}));
			// Expected output: Array [2, 4, 6]

			(I) Syntax:

				Array.from(arrayLike)
				Array.from(arrayLike, mapFn)
				Array.from(arrayLike, mapFn, thisArg)

			(II) Parameters:

				(A) `arrayLike`: An iterable or array-like object to convert to an array.
				(B) `mapFn` (Optional): A function to call on every element of the array. If provided, every value to be added to the array is first passed through this function, and mapFn's return value is added to the array instead

					I. element: The current element being processed in the array.
					II. index: The index of the current element being processed in the array.

				(C) `thisArg` (Optional): Value to use as `this` when executing 	.

		(m) `find()`: finds the first element in the array that matches the specific condition and returns it's value using an conditional function. for example:-

			const numbers = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

			const found = numbers.find(function(element) {
			  return element > 10;
			});

			console.log(found); // Output: 12

	(vi) For Loops

		(a) "For Loops" is mostly the exact same as it's for other but If you want to use it just change for this:-
			
			for(let i = 0; i<num.length; i++){
				console.log(i)
			}
			
			To This
			
			for(let i = 0; i<num.length; i++){
				console.log(num[i])
			}

			// (note: Only the content inside the round brackets which is right after the "console.log", is the one changed so keep in mind)
			
	(vii) For Each

		(a) `forEach(callback[, thisArg])` : "Iterates over each element in the array and executes a provided callback function for each element."
		(b) It's an array method that executes a provided callback function once for each element in the array in ascending order.
		(c) The callback function takes up to three arguments: `currentValue`, `currentIndex`, and the array `array` itself. However, typically, only currentValue is used.

			numbers.forEach((value, index, array) => {});

		(d) It's a way to perform an action on each item in the array without the need for explicit loops like for or while.
		(e) The optional `thisArg` parameter can be used to set the value of this within the callback function
		
		Example:-

			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
			numbers.forEach((number) => {
    			console.log(number * 2);
			});
		
		Here's another example where all perimeters are getting used:-

			const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
			colors.forEach(function(currentValue, currentIndex, array) {
			    console.log(`Color at index ${currentIndex}: ${currentValue}`);
			});

			// Output:
			// Color at index 0: red
			// Color at index 1: green
			// Color at index 2: blue
			
			In this example:

				`currentValue` represents the current element in the array (colors).
				`currentIndex` represents the index of the current element.
				`array` represents the original array (colors).

	(viii) Map

		(a) "Map" is same as "ForEach" but instead of making an operation it creates a new array. here's the example code for it:-

			let a = array.map((value)=>{
				console.log(value *2)
			})

	(ix) Filter

		(a) `filter(callback[, thisArg])` : "Creates a new array containing all elements from the original array that satisfy a provided testing function (callback)."
		(b) `filter()` is an array method that creates a new array by iterating over each element of the original array.
		(c) It applies a provided callback function to each element.
		(d) Elements that meet the criteria specified in the callback function are included in the new array, while those that don't meet the criteria are excluded.
		(e) The optional thisArg parameter allows you to set the value of this within the callback function.
		
		Example:-

			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
			const smaller_numbers = numbers.filter((number) => {
			    return number<5;
			});
			console.log(smaller_numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

			In the example, filter() is used to create a new array `smaller_numbers` containing only the numbers smaller than 5 from the `numbers` array.

	(x) Reduce
		
		(a) `reduce(callback[, initialValue])` : "Applies a provided callback function to each element of an array, accumulating the results into a single value. The `reduce` function is used to transform an array into a single value, such as a sum, average, or concatenated string."
		(b) `reduce()` is an array method that iterates over each element of the array, applying a callback function to accumulate the values into a single result. for Example:-

			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
			const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
			    return accumulator + currentValue;
			}, 0);
			console.log(sum); // Output: 15

Section: Browser Environment JavaScript

12. `Window` Object

	(i) The `window` object is a fundamental object in JavaScript that represents the browser `window` or the global context in which your JavaScript code is executed when running in a web browser environment. It provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser and the document being displayed. The window object is the global object in a browser environment. This means that variables and functions declared in the global scope are properties and methods of the window object. For example, if you declare a variable `x` in the global scope, it becomes `window.x` You can write it any way you want

		let x = 42;
		console.log(window.x); // Outputs: 42

	(ii) window Object: The window object is the top-level object of the BOM. It represents the browser window or tab and serves as the global object for JavaScript in the browser. You can access properties and methods related to the browser through this object.

		// Accessing the browser's location
		console.log(location.href);

		// Opening a new browser window
		window.open("https://www.example.com");

	and 'Window' object also contains

	(ii) Core of JavaScript
	(iii) Document Object Model (DOM)
	(iv) Browser Object Model

13. DOM

	(i) The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically. The DOM represents the document as a tree of objects where each object corresponds to a part of the page, such as elements, attributes, and text. It provides a structured way to interact with and manipulate web content using programming languages like JavaScript.

	Here are some key aspects and functions of the DOM:

	(ii) Document Structure Representation: The DOM represents an HTML or XML document as a tree structure of nodes. Each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or text content within the document. The top node is called the `document` node, representing the entire document.

	(iii) Traversal functions
		
		(a) Traversal functions are methods that allow you to navigate the DOM tree by moving between different elements or nodes. These functions are essential for selecting specific elements or nodes based on their relationships to other elements. Common DOM traversal functions include:
		
		(b) `parentNode`: This property allows you to access the parent element of a given node. You can use it to move up the DOM tree one level.

			const childElement = document.getElementById("child");
			const parentElement = childElement.parentNode;

		(c) `childNodes`: This property returns a collection of all child nodes (including elements, text nodes, and comments) of a given element. You can use it to access and iterate through the children of an element.

			const parentElement = document.getElementById("parent");
			const childNodes = parentElement.childNodes;

		(d) `firstChild` and `lastChild`: These properties allow you to access the first and last child nodes of an element, respectively.

			const parentElement = document.getElementById("parent");
			const firstChild = parentElement.firstChild;
			const lastChild = parentElement.lastChild;

		(e) `firstElementChild` and `lastElementChild`: These properties allow you to access the first and last child of an element, respectively, It's similar to `firstChild` and `lastChild` property but it only targets Element Nodes not any type of nodes.

			const parentElement = document.getElementById("parent");
			const firstChild = parentElement.firstElementChild;
			const lastChild = parentElement.lastElementChild;

		(f) `nextSibling` and `previousSibling`: These properties allow you to access the next and previous sibling nodes of an element, respectively.

			const element = document.getElementById("current");
			const nextSibling = element.nextSibling;
			const previousSibling = element.previousSibling;

		(g) `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling`: These properties are similar to `nextSibling` and `previousSibling`, but they specifically target the next and previous sibling elements (HTML elements) rather than any type of node. (recommended)

			const element = document.getElementById("current");
			const nextElementSibling = element.nextElementSibling;
			const previousElementSibling = element.previousElementSibling;

		(Note: You can These properties over-and-over to get your element, for example if you've selected an element and you want to get an element which is inside another element which inside the currect element then you can use the `firstElementChild` property over-and-over)
			
		(h) `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`: These methods allow you to select elements within the DOM tree using CSS-style selectors. You can use them to find elements based on their attributes, classes, or other properties.

			const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");
			const singleElement = document.querySelector("#myId");

	(iv) Table Navigation

		(a) Table navigation in typically involves traversing the rows and cells of an HTML table and interacting with them dynamically. You can achieve table navigation using various DOM methods and properties. 
		
		Here's an overview of how you can navigate and manipulate tables in :-

		Accessing the Table Element:

		(b) First, you need to obtain a reference to the HTML table element. You can do this using the document.`getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, or similar DOM methods, depending on how your table is defined in the HTML.
			
			const table = document.getElementById("myTable");

		(c) Accessing Rows and Cells: Once you have a reference to the table, you can access its rows and cells using properties and methods like `rows`, `insertRow`, `deleteRow`, `cells`, etc.

			(I) You can access rows using various methods in JavaScript, such as `getElementById`, `querySelector`, or by using the table's rows collection. Here's how you can access the rows:-

				// Using getElementById (assuming you have set the "id" attribute on your table)
				const table = document.getElementById("myTable");
				const rows = table.getElementsByTagName("tr");

				// Using querySelector to select the table and then the rows
				const table = document.querySelector("#myTable");
				const rows = table.querySelectorAll("tr");

				// Using the rows collection directly
				const table = document.getElementById("myTable");
				const rows = table.rows; // This is a collection of all the rows in the table

				(Note: You can access tags inside the element You've selected by putting the tag-name of the child element, and you can do that as many times as you want)

		(d) Iterating Through Rows and Cells: You can use loops to iterate through the rows and cells of the table. Common loops include `for`, for...of, and `forEach`.

			// Iterate through all rows
			for (let i = 0; i < table.rows.length; i++) {
			    const row = table.rows[i];
			    // Iterate through cells in the current row
			    for (let j = 0; j < row.cells.length; j++) {
			        const cell = row.cells[j];
			        // Perform actions with the cell content
			    }
			}

		(e) Modifying Table Data: You can update the content of table cells or rows by modifying the `textContent` or `innerHTML` property of the respective cell.

			cell.textContent = "New Value";

		(f) Adding and Removing Rows: You can add new rows to the table using the insertRow method and remove rows using the `deleteRow` method.

			// Add a new row at the end of the table
			const newRow = table.insertRow();

			// Remove a specific row
			table.deleteRow(1);
			
		(g) Creating and Appending Elements: You can dynamically create HTML elements (e.g., `<tr>`, `<td>`) and append them to the table using methods like `createElement` and `appendChild`.

			const newRow = document.createElement("tr");
			const newCell = document.createElement("td");
			newCell.textContent = "New Cell";
			newRow.appendChild(newCell);
			table.appendChild(newRow);

	(v) Document Object

		The `Document` object is a fundamental part of the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. It represents the web page or document displayed in a web browser and provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of the document. The Document object serves as the entry point to the DOM tree and allows you to access and modify elements, attributes, and text within the document. Here are some key aspects and functions of the Document object:
		
		DOM Tree: "https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif"

		(a) Accessing Elements:

			(I) `getElementById(id)`: Returns the element with the specified id attribute.

				let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
				
				(a) If you gave your element an id then most of the Modern Browser provides you that Element in a variable with the name of your id for example:-

					HTML:

						<div id="box"></div>
					
					JS:

						console.log(box) // returns the Element with the id 'box'

					(Note: It's important to Note that it depends on browser However most the modern browsers supports it but some may not, so Consider using The Function Method Instead so the user won't face any Problems.)

			(II) `getElementsByClassName(className)`: Returns a collection of elements with the specified class name.

				let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

				(Note: It requires an Index Value to select an element in the collection even if it's just one, If you wanna edit all of them you have to run a Loop for each of them)

			(III) `getElementsByTagName(tagName)`: Returns a collection of elements with the specified tag name.

				let paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

			(IV) `querySelector(selector)`: Returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector.

				let firstDiv = document.querySelector("div");

			(V) `querySelectorAll(selector)`: Returns a collection of elements that match the specified CSS selector.

				let allLinks = document.querySelectorAll("a");

			(Note: The arguments of `querySelector(selector)` and `querySelectorAll(selector)` should be same as CSS selecter means you can put something like this as the argument: ".myclass" or "#myelement")

		(b) Creating and Modifying Elements:

			(I) `createElement(tagName)`: Creates a new element with the specified tag name.

				let newDiv = document.createElement("div");

			(II) `appendChild()`: This method is used to add a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node.

				const parentElement = document.getElementById('parent');
				const newChild = document.createElement('p');
				parentElement.appendChild(newChild);

			(III) `prepend()` function is used to insert a set of specified elements or nodes at the beginning of the target element. This allows you to prepend content to the beginning of an element.

				const parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
				const newElement = document.createElement('p');
				const textNode = document.createTextNode('This is prepended content.');
				newElement.appendChild(textNode);
				parent.prepend(newElement);

			(IV) `replaceChild()`: This method replaces a child node within a specified parent node with a new node.

				const parentElement = document.getElementById('parent');
				const newChild = document.createElement('p');
				const oldChild = document.getElementById('oldChild');
				parentElement.replaceChild(newChild, oldChild);
				
			(V) `removeChild(node)`: Removes a child node from its parent node.

				let childElement = document.getElementById("child");
				parentElement.removeChild(childElement);

			(VI) `after()`: Inserts HTML content or elements after the specified element. It adds content or elements as a sibling immediately following the target element.

				const targetElement = document.getElementById('targetElement');
				const newElement = document.createElement('p');
				newElement.textContent = 'This is inserted after the target element';
				targetElement.after(newElement);

			(VII) `before()` inserts HTML content or elements before the specified element. It adds content or elements as a sibling immediately preceding the target element.

				const targetElement = document.getElementById('targetElement');
				const newElement = document.createElement('p');
				newElement.textContent = 'This is inserted before the target element';
				targetElement.before(newElement);

			(VIII) `replaceWith()` replaces an element in with one or more new elements. It removes the specified element and inserts the new elements in its place.

				const oldElement = document.getElementById('oldElement');
				const newElement = document.createElement('p');
				newElement.textContent = 'This is the new element replacing the old one.';
				oldElement.replaceWith(newElement);

				(A) In this example, the `replaceWith()` function replaces the `oldElement` with the newly created `newElement`. The contents of `oldElement` are entirely replaced with the contents of `newElement`, effectively updating the DOM structure.
				
			(IX) `insertAdjacentHTML/Element/Text` Functions:-

				(A) `insertAdjacentHTML()`: This method allows you to insert HTML at a specified position relative to the element invoking the method. You can specify positions such as 'beforebegin', 'afterbegin', 'beforeend', and 'afterend'.

					const element = document.getElementById('target');
					element.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', '<p>This is inserted after the target element</p>');

				(B) `insertAdjacentElement()`: This method is similar to insertAdjacentHTML(), but it allows you to insert a DOM element instead of HTML text.

					const element = document.getElementById('target');
					const newElement = document.createElement('p');
					newElement.textContent = 'New element';
					element.insertAdjacentElement('afterend', newElement);

				(C) `insertAdjacentText()`: This method allows you to insert text as a sibling, before, or after the specified element.

					const element = document.getElementById('target');
					element.insertAdjacentText('beforebegin', 'This text is inserted before the target element');
				
				Arguments:
				
				(D) `positon`: positon can be one of the following:-
					
					I. `beforebegin`: Insert HTML immediately before element.
					II. `afterbegin`: Insert HTML into element at the beginning.
					III. `beforeend`: Insert HTML into element at the end.
					IV. `afterend`: Insert HTML immediately after element.

				(E) `content`: this should be relative to the name of the function like for `insertAdjacentHTML`, you should provide it The HTML code as a String for example:- 
					
					"<p>This is an HTML code as a String</p>"

			(XII) `insertBefore()`: This method inserts a node before a specified child node as a new child of a specified parent node.

				const parentElement = document.getElementById('parent');
				const newChild = document.createElement('p');
				const referenceNode = document.getElementById('reference');
				parentElement.insertBefore(newChild, referenceNode);

			(XIII) `insertAfter()`: This method inserts a node after a specified child node as a new child of a specified parent node.

				const parentElement = document.getElementById('parent');
				const newChild = document.createElement('p');
				const referenceNode = document.getElementById('reference');
				parentElement.insertAfter(newChild, referenceNode);

			(XIV) `createTextNode`(): This method creates a new text node with the specified text content and appends it to the specified parent node.

				const newText = document.createTextNode('This is a new text node');
				const parentElement = document.getElementById('parent');
				parentElement.appendChild(newText);
				
		(c) Modifying Element Attributes and Content:

			Attribute Functions & Properties:-

			(I) `getAttribute(name)`: Retrieves the value of an element's attribute.

				let srcValue = imageElement.getAttribute("src");

			(II) `setAttribute(name, value)`: Sets the value of an element's attribute.

				imageElement.setAttribute("alt", "A beautiful landscape");
			
			(III) `hasAttribute(name)`: checks if an element has a specific attribute. It's used with elements to determine whether the specified element has the attribute or not, and It returns a Boolean value.

				for Example :-

					HTML:

					<p id="myParagraph" title="Sample Title">Some text.</p>

					JavaScript:

						let paragraph = document.getElementById("myParagraph");
						// Check if the paragraph has the "title" attribute

						if (paragraph.hasAttribute("title")) {
						  console.log("The paragraph has a title attribute");
						} else {
						  console.log("The paragraph does not have a title attribute");
						}

			(IV) `removeAttribute(name)`: removes a specified attribute from an HTML element for Example:-

				HTML:

					<p id="myParagraph" title="Sample Title" class="highlight">Some text.</p>

				JavaScript:

					let paragraph = document.getElementById("myParagraph");
  
  					// Removing the 'title' attribute
  					paragraph.removeAttribute("title");

  					// Removing the 'class' attribute
  					paragraph.removeAttribute("class");

  					// Display the element's attributes after removal
  					console.log(paragraph.attributes);

			(V) `attributes`: property is used to access a collection of all the attributes of a specified element. It returns a NamedNodeMap, which is similar to an array but not exactly an array, containing all the attributes of the specified element. for Example:- 

				HTML:

					<p id="myParagraph" title="Sample Title" class="highlight">Some text.</p>

				JavaScript:

					let paragraph = document.getElementById("myParagraph");
  					// Accessing the attributes of the paragraph element
  					let attributeList = paragraph.attributes;

  					// Loop through the list of attributes
  					for (let i = 0; i < attributeList.length; i++) {
  					  	console.log(attributeList[i].name + " = " + attributeList[i].value);
  					}

			(VI) `data-*`: Attribute
			
				(A) `data-*`: attribute in HTML allows you to add your custom attribute but it should start with `data-` and then name of your attribute, and you can put any value you want, and you can also retrieve that value using `dataset` property in js and then the the name of your attribute which is after `data-`, and you can perform task with them in anyway you want to.

				for Example:-

					HTML:

						<div id="myElement" data-name="John" data-age="30"></div>

					JavaScript:

						const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
						console.log(element.dataset.name); // Prints: "John"
						console.log(element.dataset.age); // Prints: "30"

			(VII) Class Manipulation: `className` and `classList` are properties that are used to interact with the CSS classes of an HTML element. These properties allow you to manipulate the class attribute of an element
	
				(a) `className` property returns a string that represents the class attribute of the element.
				(b) `classList` property returns a collection of the class names of the element.

				Here's some of the common functions used with `classList` properties:

				(c) `add(className)`: Adds a class to the element. If the class already exists, it won't add another instance of the same class.
				(d) `remove(className)`: Removes a class from the element. If the class doesn't exist, this method has no effect.
				(e) `toggle(className)`: Toggles a class on the element. If the class exists, it will be removed; if it doesn't exist, it will be added.
				(f) `contains(className)`: Checks whether the element has a specific class. Returns true if the class exists, false otherwise.

				for Example:-

					HTML:

					    <p id="myParagraph" class="content">Some content here.</p>
					    <button onclick="changeStyle()">Change Style</button>

					CSS:

					    .highlight {
					        color: red;
					    }

					JavaScript:

					    const changeStyle = ()=>{

							// Getting The Element
					        let element = document.getElementById("myParagraph");

					       	element.className // returns the All of the classes as a String

							// Add a Class
					        element.classList.add("highlight");

							// remove a Class
					        element.classList.remove("content");
					        
							// check if an element has a class and it returns a Boolean
					        element.classList.contains("highlight");
							
							// Toggles The presence of a Class in the element
					        element.classList.toggle("highlight");
					    }

			Content Modifying Element Tags:-

			(VII) `textContent`: Gets and sets the text content of an element, excluding HTML tags.

				paragraphElement.textContent = "Updated text content";

			(VIII) `innerHTML` is a property of an HTML element, such as a <div> or a <p>. It represents the content of the element as a string, including both the HTML markup and the text content within the element. You can also set the innerHTML property to change the content of an element. This is a powerful way to dynamically update the content of a webpage.

				// Get the innerHTML of an element
				let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
				let content = element.innerHTML;

				// Set the innerHTML of an element
				element.innerHTML = "<p>New content</p>";

			(IX) `outerHTML` is similar to `innerHTML`, but it represents the entire HTML element, including its start tag, end tag, and all of its content. It returns the element and its contents as a string. You can use `outerHTML` to replace an entire element, including itself, with new HTML content.

				// Get the outerHTML of an element
				let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
				let elementHTML = element.outerHTML;

				// Replace an element with new HTML content
				element.outerHTML = "<div>New element</div>";

			(X) `Document.write()`: writes a string of text to a document stream, such as an HTML document. It's often used for testing and simple demonstrations, but it's not recommended for use in regular scripts, as it can overwrite the entire document if used after the document has finished loading. for example:-

				document.write("Hello, World!");
				
		(d) `addEventListener(event, callback)` Function

			(I) `addEventListener(event, callback)`: attaches to HTML elements to listen for specific events (such as user interactions or changes in the page) and respond to them when they occur

				Syntax:-

					element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction);

			(II) `element`: The HTML element to which you want to attach the event listener.

			(III) eventType: The type of event you want to listen for, such as "click," "mouseover," "keydown," etc. Here's a full list of eventTypes:-

				Mouse Events:-

				(A) `click`: Occurs when a mouse click is detected.
				(B) `mousedown`: Fired when the mouse button is pressed.
				(C) `mouseup`: Fired when the mouse button is released.
				(D) `mousemove`: Occurs when the mouse pointer moves.
				(E) `mouseover`: Triggered when the mouse enters an element.
				(F) `mouseout`: Fired when the mouse leaves an element.
				(G) `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`: Similar to `mouseover` and `mouseout` but do not bubble.

				Keyboard Events:-

				(H) `keydown`: Occurs when a keyboard key is pressed.
				(I) `keyup`: Fired when a keyboard key is released.
				(J) `keypress`: Fired when a character key is pressed.
				
				Form Events:-

				(K) `submit`: Triggered when a form is submitted.
				(L) `reset`: Fired when a form is reset.
				(M) `input`: Occurs when the value of an input field changes.
				(N) `change`: Fired when the value of a form element changes (e.g., select, checkbox).

				Focus Events:-

				(O) `focus`: Occurs when an element receives focus.
				(P) `blur`: Fired when an element loses focus.
				
				Window Events:-

				(Q) `load`: Triggered when a web page finishes loading.
				(R) `unload`: Fired when a page is unloaded or refreshed.
				(S) `resize`: Occurs when the browser window is resized.
				(T) `scroll`: Fired when the user scrolls the page.

				Document Events:-

				(U) `DOMContentLoaded`: Occurs when the HTML document is completely loaded and parsed.
				(V) `readystatechange`: Fired when the ready state of the document changes.
				Touch Events (for mobile devices):-
				(W) `touchstart`: Fired when a touch point is placed on the touch surface.
				(X) `touchend`: Triggered when a touch point is removed from the touch surface.
				(Y) `touchmove`: Occurs when a touch point is moved along the touch surface.
				(Z) `touchcancel`: Fired when a touch event is canceled.

				Drag and Drop Events:-

				(ZA) `dragstart`: Occurs when an element starts to be dragged.
				(ZB) `dragend`: Fired when the element is no longer being dragged.
				(ZC) `dragenter`, `dragover`, `dragleave`: Events related to dragging elements over a target.
				(ZD) `drop`: Occurs when a dragged element is dropped on a target.

				Media Events (for audio and video):-

				(ZE) `play`, `pause`, `ended`: Events related to media playback.

				Custom Events:-

				(ZF) You can create custom events using the `CustomEvent` constructor and dispatch them on DOM elements.

			(IV) `callbackFunction`: A function that will be called when the specified event occurs.

			Example:-

				const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

				button.addEventListener("click", ()=>{

					alert("Button clicked!");

				});

			Key Concepts and Usage:

			(V) Event Types: Events can be various interactions or occurrences, such as clicks, keypresses, mouse movements, form submissions, and more. Different HTML elements support different types of events.
			(VI) Callback Function: The callback function is executed when the specified event occurs. It can contain the code that responds to the event. It typically takes an event object as its parameter, allowing you to access information about the event, like the target element or mouse coordinates.
			(VII) `Event Flow`: Events propagate through the DOM tree in two phases: capturing and bubbling. You can control the phase in which the event listener operates by passing an optional third argument, `useCapture`, to `addEventListener`.

				(A) `useCapture` set to true (default): Event listener operates during the capturing phase, starting from the outermost ancestor and moving inward to the target element.

				(B) `useCapture` set to false or omitted: Event listener operates during the bubbling phase, starting from the target element and moving outward to the outermost ancestor.

					element.addEventListener("click", callbackFunction, useCapture);

			(VIII) Event Removal: To remove an event listener, you should use the `removeEventListener` method. This is important to avoid memory leaks when an element is removed from the DOM or when you no longer need the listener.

				element.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
					console.log("click detected)
				});

				// Remove the Event Listener
				element.removeEventListener("click", ()=>{
					console.log("click detected)
				});

				(Note: You have to provide it both `event` and `handler`, keep in mind that yhe reference of `event` and `handler` have to be EXACT as `addEventListener`(s) reference or else it won't work)

			(IX) Event Object: The event object provides information about the event, such as the target element, event type, and additional data specific to the event type.

				element.addEventListener("click", function(event) {

				  console.log(event.type); // "click"

				  console.log(event.target); // The clicked element

				});

		(e) Form Handling:

			(I) `submit()`: Submits a form.

				formElement.submit();

		(f) Nodes

			(I) 'nodes' typically refer to elements in the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document. Nodes are the individual elements or parts within this tree structure, and they can represent HTML elements, text, attributes, or other parts of the document

			Here are some common types of nodes in the DOM:

			(II) 'Element Nodes' : These nodes represent HTML elements and are the most common type of nodes in the DOM. For example, <div>, <p>, <a>, and <img> elements are represented as element nodes.
			(III) 'Text Nodes' : Text nodes represent the text content within an element. For example, the text between <p>...</p> tags is represented as a text node.
			(IV) 'Attribute Nodes' : These nodes represent the attributes of an element. For example, if you have an <a> element with an href attribute, the href attribute itself is represented as an attribute node.
			(V) 'Comment Nodes' : Comment nodes represent comments within the HTML code. For example, <!-- This is a comment --> is represented as a comment node.
			(VI) 'Document Nodes' : The top-level node in the DOM tree is the document node, representing the entire HTML or XML document. It serves as the root of the DOM hierarchy.

			(VII) Nodes are organized hierarchically, forming a tree structure. Elements contain other elements, text nodes, and potentially other types of nodes as children. This hierarchy reflects the nesting of elements in the HTML document.

			Here's a simple example of how to access and manipulate nodes in JavaScript:-

				// Accessing an element node by its ID
				const elementNode = document.getElementById("myElement");

				// Accessing a text node
				const textNode = elementNode.firstChild; // Assuming the text node is the first child

				// Modifying an element's text content
				elementNode.textContent = "New content";

				// Accessing and modifying an attribute
				const linkElement = document.getElementById("myLink");
				const hrefAttribute = linkElement.getAttribute("href");
				linkElement.setAttribute("href", "https://www.example.com");

				// Creating a new element node
				const newElement = document.createElement("div");
				newElement.textContent = "New element content";
				document.body.appendChild(newElement);

			Here's Some Properties and Built-in Functions of Nodes:-

			(VIII) `nodeName` Property:

				(A) The nodeName property is used to retrieve the name of the node of an element within the DOM. It returns the name of the HTML tag in uppercase or the node name in the case of non-HTML elements.
				(B) It is particularly useful when you need to identify the type of the node, such as whether it's a `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, or any other type of node.

				Example :-

					HTML:

						<div id="myDiv"></div>

					JavaScript:

						const element = document.getElementById('myDiv');
						console.log(element.nodeName); // "DIV"

			(IX) `nodeValue` property
				
				(A) It represents the value of the current node, depending on its type. This property is accessible for different types of nodes such as Element, Text, Comment, etc.

				(B) For Element nodes: The nodeValue property returns `null`. If you want to access the text content of an element node, you can use the textContent property instead.

				(C) For Text nodes: The nodeValue property returns the text content of the text node.

				(D) For Comment nodes: The nodeValue property returns the content of the comment node.
				
				for Example:-

					<!DOCTYPE html>
					<html>
					<body>

					<p id="demo">Some text.</p>

					<script>
					  let txt = document.getElementById("demo").firstChild;
					  console.log(txt.nodeValue); // Output: "Some text."

					  let comment = document.createComment("I am a comment");
					  console.log(comment.nodeValue); // Output: "I am a comment"
					</script>

					</body>
					</html>
					
			(X) `data` Property (NOT THE ATTRIBUTE ONE):-
				
				(a) `data` property is specific to text nodes in the DOM. It represents the text content of a text node, which is similar to the `nodeValue` property but it's used for text nodes specifically. The `data` property provides the same functionality as `nodeValue` but is used primarily for text nodes.

				Here's an example of how to use the data property:-

					HTML:

						<p id="demo">Some text.</p>

					JavaScript:

					  	let txt = document.getElementById("demo").firstChild;
					  	console.log(txt.data); // Output: "Some text."

			(XI) `remove()` removes the selected element

				Here is an example of how to use the remove() method:

				const elementToRemove = document.getElementById('elementToRemove');
				elementToRemove.remove();

		(g) `Style` Object

			(I)`style`: allows you to access and manipulate the inline CSS styles of an element directly through JavaScript
			(II) You can access the style object of an HTML element using JavaScript. For example:

				const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
				const styles = element.style;

			(III) You can change the CSS properties of an element using the style object. Each CSS property corresponds to a property of the style object, and you can set or retrieve their values as follows:

				// Get the value of a CSS property
				const backgroundColor = element.style.backgroundColor;

				// Set the value of a CSS property
				element.style.color = "blue";
				element.style.fontSize = "16px";
				element.style.backgroundColor = "lightgray";

			(IV) Property Names: When accessing CSS properties using the style object, use camelCase versions of the CSS property names. For example, use `backgroundColor` instead of `background-color`.
			(V) Values: Property values should be assigned as strings, just like in CSS. Numeric values that represent lengths or numbers can be assigned as strings with units (e.g., "16px" or "2rem").
			(VI) Inline Styles: The style object only deals with inline styles defined in the style attribute of the element. It won't access or modify styles defined in external stylesheets or through the `class` attribute.

		(h) Document.element

			(a) You can also directly write these specific tags list down here to get those elements 
			(note: It's limited to these listed down here only if you want to use tags other then these, than use functions like `getElementsByClassName()[]` )

			(b) Document.body: Represents the <body> element of the HTML document and allows you to access and manipulate its content.
			(c) Document.head: Represents the <head> element of the HTML document, which contains metadata and links to external resources.
			(d) Document.documentElement: Represents the root element of the HTML document, typically the <html> element, allowing access to the entire document structure. 
			(e) Document.title: Allows you to access and modify the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
		
	(vi) Finding Functions

		(a) `matches()`, `closest()`, and `contains()` are three JavaScript functions used in the context of working with the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements

		Explaination individually :-

		(b) `matches()`: It's used to check whether an element matches a specific CSS selector. It returns `true` if the element matches the selector; otherwise, it returns `false`.This function is often used in event handling and selecting elements based on specific criteria. for example:-

			// Check if an element with ID "myElement" is a <div>
			const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
			const isDiv = element.matches("div");

			// Check if an element with class "active" is a <button>
			const button = document.querySelector(".active");
			const isButton = button.matches("button");

		(c) `closest()` Function: The `closest()` function is used to find the closest ancestor (parent or higher-level ancestor) of an element that matches a specified CSS selector.It is helpful for traversing the DOM tree upwards from a given element to find a specific ancestor.for example:-

			// Find the closest <div> ancestor of a <button> element
			const button = document.querySelector("button");
			const closestDiv = button.closest("div");
			
			// Find the closest element with class "container" of an element with class "item"
			const item = document.querySelector(".item");
			const closestContainer = item.closest(".container");

			(Note: It returns The ancestor or parent of the Element not a Booleon)
		
		(d) `contains()` Function: The `contains()` function is used to check if one DOM element is a descendant of another element. It returns 'true' if the specified element is a descendant; otherwise, it returns 'false'. It is useful for checking if one element contains another, such as checking if a parent element contains a child element. Example: 	

			// Check if an element with ID "parent" contains an element with ID "child"
			const parent = document.getElementById("parent");
			const child = document.getElementById("child");
			const isChildContained = parent.contains(child);
			
			// Check if the document body contains an element with class "my-element"
			const isElementContained = document.body.contains(document.querySelector(".my-element"));
			
	XML and HTML Compatibility: The DOM can be used with both XML and HTML documents, making it versatile for various web development tasks.The DOM plays a crucial role in modern web development, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications. It bridges the gap between the structure of web documents and the programming languages used to build web applications, allowing for rich user experiences and real-time updates.

14. BOM

	(i) The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a part of the JavaScript programming language that represents and controls the web browser itself. Unlike the Document Object Model (DOM), which deals with the structure and content of web documents (HTML, XML), the BOM focuses on controlling and interacting with the browser's features and behavior. It provides a set of objects and methods to manage browser-specific functionality and properties. Here are some key aspects and functions of the BOM:
	
	(ii) `Prompt/Alert/Confirm` Functions

		(a) `prompt(message, defaultValue)` :"It's used to display a dialog box that prompts the user to enter some input. It takes two arguments:-

			(I) message: The message to display to the user, typically instructing them on what to enter.
			(II) DefaultValue (optional): The default value pre-filled in the input field.

			for example:

				let userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:", "John Doe");

				(A) In this example, a dialog box will appear with the message "Please enter your name:" and an input field pre-filled with "John Doe." The user can enter their name, and the input will be stored in the userInput variable.

			(III) `prompt()` returns the text entered by the user as a string or null if the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the dialog.

		(b) `alert(message)` :"alert() is used to display a simple message to the user in a dialog box. It typically contains an "OK" button to close the dialog." for example:-

			alert("Hello, World!");

			(IV) The above code will display a dialog box with the message "Hello, World!" and an "OK" button. It's commonly used for displaying informative messages to users.

		(c) `confirm(message)` :" : Displays a message in a confirm dialog with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons." for example:-

			let result = confirm("Are you sure?");


			// Display an alert message
			window.alert("This is an alert!");

			// Show a confirmation dialog
			const result = window.confirm("Are you sure?");

	(ii) Navigation Control:

		(a) `Location` Object

			The `location` object in JavaScript represents the current URL of the web page displayed in the browser. It provides access to various properties and methods that allow you to interact with and manipulate the URL. The `location` object is a property of the global window object, making it easily accessible in your scripts. Here are some of the key properties and methods of the `location` object:

			(I) `href`: This property contains the complete URL of the current web page, including the protocol (e.g., "http" or "https"), domain, port, path, and query parameters.

				let currentURL = location.href;

			(II) `host`: The `host` property contains the domain and port number of the current URL.

				let domainAndPort = location.host;

			(III) `hostname`: The `hostname` property holds the domain name of the current URL, excluding the port number.

				let domainName = location.hostname;

			(IV) `protocol`: This property represents the `protocol` or scheme of the current URL (e.g., "http:" or "https:").

				let currentProtocol = location.protocol;

			(V) `port`: The `port` property contains the port number specified in the URL. It defaults to 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.

				let currentPort = location.port;

			(VI) `pathname`: The `pathname` property represents the path part of the URL, including any directories or filenames.

				let currentPath = location.pathname;

			(VII) `search`: The `search` property contains the query string portion of the URL, including the leading "?" character.

				let queryString = location.search;

			(VIII) `hash`: The `hash` property contains the fragment identifier part of the URL, including the leading "#" character. It is often used to navigate within the same page.

				let fragmentIdentifier = location.hash;

			(IX) assign(url): The assign() method loads a new URL and replaces the current page's URL in the browser's history.

				location.assign("https://www.example.com");

			(X) `replace(url)`: The `replace()` method loads a new URL and replaces the current page's URL in the browser's history without creating a new entry in the history.

				location.replace("https://www.example.com");

			(XI) `reload()`: `The reload()` method reloads the current page.

				location.reload();

		(b) `history` Object

			(I) `history` object includes various properties and methods that allow you to navigate the browser's history and manipulate the browsing session.
			
			Some of the key properties and methods of the history object include:

			(II) `back()`: This method loads the previous URL in the history list, which is the equivalent of clicking the browser's back button.
			(III) `forward()`: This method loads the next URL in the history list, which is the equivalent of clicking the browser's forward button.
			(IV) `go()`: This method loads a specific URL from the history list, with navigation relative to the current page.
			(V) length: This property returns the number of URLs in the history list.
			(VI) `pushState()`: This method adds a new state to the browser history, allowing you to modify the URL of the current document without reloading the page.
			(VII) `replaceState()`: This method modifies the current history entry, replacing it with the new state, but without creating a new entry in the history stack.
			
			Here's an example of using the history object to navigate through the browser's history:

				// Go back one page in the history
				history.back();

				// Go forward one page in the history
				history.forward();

				// Go back or forward in history by a specific number of pages
				history.go(-2); // Goes back two pages in the history
				history.go(3); // Goes forward three pages in the history

				// Accessing the length of the history list
				console.log(history.length);

				// Adding a new state to the history
				history.pushState({ page: 2 }, "Page 2", "page2.html");

				// Modifying the current history entry
				history.replaceState({ page: 3 }, "Page 3", "page3.html");

	(iii) Timeout Functions

		(a) `setTimeout()`: This function executes a specified function or a specified piece of code 'ONCE' after a specified delay. It takes two main arguments: a function or a piece of code to execute and the delay time in milliseconds before the execution. Optionally, it can take additional arguments that will be passed to the function. for Example:-

			let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
			    console.log('Delayed log after 2 seconds');
			}, 2000);
			console.log(timeoutID) // Returns The ID of The Timeout which is essential to Terminate Timeouts later on

			Addition Arguments Example:-

			const sum = (a, b, c)=>{
            	console.log(a+b+c)
        	};
        	const timeoutID1 = setTimeout(sum, 5000, 5, 3, 2); //argument after the second argument will be passed to the function
			// outputs: 10

		(b) `setInterval()`: This function 'REPEATEDLY' executes a specified function or a specified piece of code at a specified time interval. It also takes two main arguments: a function or a piece of code to execute and the time interval in milliseconds between each execution. Like `setTimeout()`, it can also take additional arguments.

			let count = 0;

			let intervalTimeoutID = setInterval(() => {

			    count++;
			    console.log('Interval log:', count);

			    if (count >= 5) {
			        clearInterval(intervalTimeoutID); // Stop the interval after 5 executions
			    }

			}, 1000);

			console.log(intervalTimeoutID)

		(c) You can Terminate any scheduled timeout by using `clearTimeout()` and `clearInterval()`, respectively and They requires ID of the Timeout which is stored inside the variable which is running the Timeout.

		(Note: The variable which is running The Timeout Function contains The ID of The Timeout)

	(vii) `screen` Object

		// Get screen width and height
		const screenWidth = window.screen.width;
		const screenHeight = window.screen.height;

	(viii) `navigator` Object

		// Get browser name and version
		const browserName = navigator.appName;
		const browserVersion = navigator.appVersion;

	(ix) Popup Windows:

		// Open a new popup window
		const newWindow = window.open("https://www.example.com", "Popup", "width=400,height=300");

	(xiv) The BOM is a powerful part of JavaScript that allows web developers to interact with and control the browser's behavior, manage user interface elements, and implement various client-side features. It plays a vital role in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
	
15. Auto-Correction by Browser

	(i) Auto-correction by browsers in HTML typically refers to the automatic correction of certain HTML and markup errors made by web developers to ensure that web pages render correctly and consistently for users. Browsers perform this auto-correction when parsing and rendering HTML documents. 
	
	Here are some common examples of auto-correction done by browsers:

	(ii) Unclosed Tags: Browsers often attempt to close unclosed HTML tags to maintain the document's structure. For example, if you forget to close a `<p>` element, the browser may automatically close it for you.

		<!-- Original Code -->
		<div>
		  <p>This is a paragraph.
		</div>
		
		<!-- Auto-Corrected by Browser -->
		<div>
		  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
		</div>
		
	(iii) Mismatched Tags: Browsers may also attempt to correct mismatched or improperly nested HTML tags to create a valid HTML structure. For instance, if you open a `<strong>` tag within a paragraph but forget to close it, the browser might close it at the end of the paragraph.

		<!-- Original Code -->
		<p>This is a <strong>bold text.</p>

		<!-- Auto-Corrected by Browser -->
		<p>This is a <strong>bold text.</strong></p>

	(iv) Attribute Quoting: Browsers may add missing attribute quotes, such as double quotes around attribute values, to ensure valid HTML.

		<!-- Original Code -->
		
		<a href=https://www.example.com>Visit Site</a>

		<!-- Auto-Corrected by Browser -->

		<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Site</a>

	(v) Self-Closing Tags: Browsers often allow self-closing tags (e.g., <img>, <br>, <input>) to be used without the trailing slash /. While not strictly required in HTML5, the browser may add it for consistency.

		<!-- Original Code -->

		<img src="image.jpg">

		<!-- Auto-Corrected by Browser -->
		
		<img src="image.jpg" />

	(vi) Lowercase Tags: HTML is case-insensitive, but browsers tend to convert tag names to lowercase for consistency.

		<!-- Original Code -->

		<A HREF="https://www.example.com">Visit Site</A>

		<!-- Auto-Corrected by Browser -->

		<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Site</a>

16. Event Attributes in HTML:

	(i) In HTML, There's some Attributes That Allows You to Run Specific Code when specific event Takes place, However It can also be Done by `addEventListener()` function, and you can also use Events from `addEventListener()` function just add 'on' prefix to them to use them as attributes in HTML, or remove 'on' prefix to use them in `addEventListener()` functions

	(Note: If you're gonna write more than 1 line of code in these attributes then, It's recommended to use functions to execute code using These Attributes.)

	(iii) if you've selected an Element which and You want to add evenType to it then you can these the events directly as properties in JavaScript.

	(iv) Examples:

		// using The Attributes in HTML

		<button onclick="()=>{console.log('Click Detected')}" id="EventElement">Click me</Button>

		// using `addEventListener` function

		let element = document.getElementById("EventElement")
		element.addEventListener("click",()=>{
			console.log("Click Detected")
		})

		// using The Attributes in JavaScript

		let element = document.getElementById("EventElement");
		element.onclick = ()=>{
			console.log("Clicked Detected");
		};

	(v) `Event` Object


		(a) when an event is triggered, an event object is automatically created and passed as an argument to the event handler function. This event object contains information and properties related to the event that was triggered. 
		
		Some common properties that can be accessed from the event object include:

		(b) `target`: This property refers to the element that triggered the event.
		(c) `type`: This property specifies the type of event that was triggered.
		(d) `currentTarget`: This property refers to the element that the event handler is attached to.
		(e) `eventPhase`: This property indicates the phase of the event flow (capturing, at target, or bubbling).
		(f) `stopPropagation()`: This method stops the propagation of the event through the DOM.
		(g) `preventDefault()`: This method prevents the default action of the event from occurring.
		(h) `stopImmediatePropagation()`: This method prevents other listeners of the same event from being called.
		(i) `clientX` and `clientY` provides the coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the browser's viewport when an event is triggered. These properties are particularly useful for tracking the position of the mouse during mouse-related events such as `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `click`.

			(a) `clientX`: This property provides the horizontal coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the viewport, excluding any scroll offset.
			(b) `clientY`: This property provides the vertical coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the viewport, excluding any scroll offset.

			for Example:-
			
				HTML:

					<div onmousemove="showCoordinates(event)" style="height:200px; width:400px; border:1px solid black;"> Move the mouse inside this box </div>

				JavaScript:

					const showCoordinates = (event)=>{
						let x = event.clientX;
						let y = event.clientY;
					  	console.log("X: " + x + " Y: " + y);
					}

		Here is an example of how you can access some of the properties from the event object:


			HTML:

				<button onclick="myFunction(event)">Click me</button>

			JavaScript:

				const myFunction = (event)=>{
				  console.log("Event type: " + event.type);
				  console.log("Target element: ", event.target);
				  console.log("Current element: ", event.currentTarget);
				}

			(Note: The `event` object can have name of your choice, you can name it whatever you want)
			
			In this example, the myFunction function is triggered by the click event on the button. It logs the type of event, the target element that triggered the event, and the current element where the event handler is attached.

17. `Synchronous` and `Asynchronous` Actions

	(i) synchronous and asynchronous actions refer to different ways in which tasks are executed in a program.
	
	(ii) Synchronous Actions: Synchronous actions are those that occur one after the other, in a sequence. When a function is called synchronously, the program waits for it to finish before moving on to the next operation. It means the program follows a strict order of execution and one operation is completed before the next one starts. This can sometimes lead to blocking behavior where a slow operation can halt the entire program until it completes.for Example:-

		console.log("First");
		console.log("Second");
		console.log("Third");
		
		In this example, the program will print "First", "Second," and "Third" in that order.

	(iii) Asynchronous Actions: Asynchronous actions, on the other hand, allow the program to continue executing other operations while waiting for a particular task to complete. In this case, the program doesn't wait for the task to finish, but it provides a callback function to be executed once the task is completed. Asynchronous actions are often used for time-consuming operations, such as making network requests or reading/writing files, to prevent blocking the execution of other parts of the program. for Example:-

		console.log("First");
		setTimeout(() => {
		    console.log("Second");
		}, 2000);
		console.log("Third");

		In this example, "First" and "Third" are printed immediately, while "Second" is printed after a 2-second delay due to the setTimeout function.

		(a) Callbacks are called "Callback - based" style of async programming. A function that does something asynchronously should provide a callback argument where we put the function to run after it's complete.

18. Advance Functions

	(i) Callback Functions:

		(WARNING: Callback Functions can Lead to Pyramid of Doom AKA Callback Hell!)

		(a) `Callback function` are functions which is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed. Callback functions are a fundamental part of JavaScript's asynchronous nature and are widely used in scenarios where operations need to be performed in a non-blocking manner.
		
		Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

			const processData = (data, successCallback, failureCallback)=>{
			  	// Simulating an asynchronous operation
			  	setTimeout(() => {
			    	if (data) {
			      		successCallback('Data processed successfully');
			    	} else {
			      		failureCallback('Error: No data to process');
			    	}
			  	}, 2000);
			}

			const successCallback = (message)=>{
			  console.log(`Success: ${message}`);
			}

			const failureCallback = (message)=>{
			  console.log(`Failure: ${message}`);
			}

			// Using the processData function with the callback functions
			processData(true, successCallback, failureCallback);
			processData(false, successCallback, failureCallback);

			In this example, the `processData()` function simulates an asynchronous operation. It takes in some data, and depending on the data's availability, it either calls the `successCallback` with a success message or the `failureCallback` with an error message.

		(b) Callbacks are called "Callback - based" style of async programming. A function that does something asynchronously should provide a callback argument where we put the function to run after it's complete.
	
	(ii) `Error()` function. 

		(a) It's used for creating an error object. This error object can then be thrown using the `throw` keyword. It is commonly used for custom error handling within JavaScript programs. When an error occurs during the execution of a script, it's helpful to have a detailed error message that can help identify the issue. The `Error()` function allows developers to create their own error messages to provide more context and information about the error.
		
		Here's an example of how the `Error()` function can be used:

		// Creating a custom error
		const customError = new Error('This is a custom error message.');

		// Throwing the error
		throw customError;

		In this example, the `Error()` function creates an error object customError with the message "This is a custom error message." Later, the error is thrown using the throw keyword. When this error is thrown, the JavaScript interpreter will stop the execution of the program and show the error message along with the stack trace, which can be helpful for debugging and identifying the cause of the error.
	
	(iii) `JSON` Object

		(a) `JSON.parse()`: This function is used to parse a JSON string, converting it into a JavaScript object.

			const jsonStr = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}';
			const obj = JSON.parse(jsonStr);
			console.log(obj.name); // Output: John

		(b) `JSON.stringify()`: This function is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

			const obj = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
			const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(obj);
			console.log(jsonStr); // Output: {"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}

		(c) `JSON.stringify()` with Replacer Function: The `stringify` function can take a replacer function as a second argument, allowing you to customize the serialization of specific properties.

			const obj = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
			const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(obj, (key, value) => (key === 'city' ? undefined : value));
			console.log(jsonStr); // Output: {"name":"John","age":30}

		(d) `JSON.stringify()` with Replacer Array: You can also use an array as a replacer, specifying the properties you want to include in the serialized JSON string.

			const obj = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
			const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(obj, ['name', 'age']);
			console.log(jsonStr); // Output: {"name":"John","age":30}
			
		(e) `JSON.stringify()` with Space Argument: The `stringify` function can also take a third argument, indicating the number of spaces to use for indentation.

			const obj = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
			const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2);
			console.log(jsonStr);
			/* Output:
			{
			  "name": "John",
			  "age": 30,
			  "city": "New York"
			} 
			*/

	(iv) The `encodeURIComponent` and `decodeURIComponent` functions are used to manage special characters in URLs. Here's a breakdown of each:

		(a) `encodeURIComponent`: The `encodeURIComponent` function is used to encode special characters in a URL. It takes a single parameter, typically a string, and replaces any special characters with their encoded counterparts. This is particularly useful when you want to append parameters to a URL. It encodes all characters except the following: A-Z a-z 0-9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( ).

			const uri = 'https://example.com/my page.html';
			const encodedURI = encodeURIComponent(uri);
			console.log(encodedURI);
			// output: "https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fmy%20page.html"

		(b) `decodeURIComponent`: The `decodeURIComponent` function performs the reverse operation of `encodeURIComponent`. It takes an encoded URI component as a parameter and decodes it, converting special characters back to their original form.

			const encoded = 'https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fmy%20page.html';
			const decoded = decodeURIComponent(encoded);
			console.log(decoded);
			// output: "https://example.com/my page.html"
			
19. Pyramid of Doom!

	(i) Pyramid of Doom, also known as Callback Hell, is a term used to describe the situation where multiple layers of nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain. It is a common issue in asynchronous programming, especially when handling multiple asynchronous operations one after the other. In JavaScript, this often occurs when dealing with multiple nested callbacks, typically in scenarios such as nested asynchronous functions, event handling, or handling multiple AJAX requests.

	An Example of the Pyramid of Doom:

		operation01(function(result01) {
		    operation02(function(result02) {
		        operation03(function(result03) {
		            operation04(function(result04) {

		            										});
		            									});
		            								});
		            							});
		            						});
		            					});
		            				});
		            			});
		            		});
		            	});
		            });
		        });
		    });
		});
	
	(ii) The code structure becomes deeply nested and challenging to read as more operations are added. 
	It leads to the following issues:

	(iii) Readability: With deeply nested callbacks, the code becomes difficult to read and understand. This can make it challenging for other developers (and even the original developer) to maintain and extend the code.

	(iv) Debugging and Error Handling: Managing errors and debugging become complex, as it's not straightforward to determine which part of the code might be causing an issue.

	(v) To avoid the Pyramid of Doom, developers often use various techniques like modularization, promises, and async/await, which allow for more structured and readable code. Promises and async/await enable a more linear flow of the code, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations without deeply nested structures. These techniques provide a more elegant and maintainable way to handle asynchronous code, making it easier to manage errors and handle complex asynchronous operations.

20. Keywords

	(i) `new`

		(a) `new` keyword is used to create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function. When used with a constructor function, new creates a new object and sets the prototype of the newly created object to the constructor function's prototype

		Here is an example of using the new keyword:

			// Constructor function
			function Person(name, age) {
			    this.name = name;
			    this.age = age;
			}

			// Creating an instance of Person using the new keyword
			const john = new Person('John', 30);

			console.log(john.name); // Output: John
			console.log(john.age); // Output: 30

		When the new keyword is used with a constructor function, it performs the following steps:

		(b) It creates a new empty object.
		(c) It sets the value of `this` keyword to the newly created object inside the constructor function.
		(d) It adds properties to the newly created object using the `this` keyword.
		(e) If the constructor function does not explicitly return an object, it implicitly returns `this`, i.e., the newly created object.
		
		Using the `new` keyword allows you to create multiple instances of an object type with their own separate properties and methods

	(ii) `this`
		
		(a) `this` keyword refers to the object that is executing the current code. The specific value of `this` depends on the context in which it is used. Its value is determined by how a function is called and where it is called. The behavior of this can be a little tricky, but understanding the various rules can help in utilizing it effectively.

		Here's a basic understanding:

		(b) Global context: When used in the global context, `this` refers to the global object, which is the `window` object in the case of browsers.

			console.log(this === window); // true

		(c) Function context: In the context of a function, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. In regular function calls, `this` refers to the global object. In object methods, `this` refers to the object that the method is a property of.

			const myObj = {
			  property: 'value',
			  myMethod: function() {
			    console.log(this.property);
			  }
			};

			myObj.myMethod(); // 'value'

		(d) Arrow functions: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` value. They inherit `this` from the enclosing scope.

			const myObj = {
			  myMethod: function() {
			    const myArrowFunc = () => {
			      console.log(this);
			    };
			    myArrowFunc();
			  }
			};

			myObj.myMethod(); // 'myObj' object

		(e) Constructor functions: In constructor functions, `this` refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function when using the `new` keyword.

			function Person(name) {
			  this.name = name;
			}

			const john = new Person('John');
			console.log(john.name); // 'John'

		Understanding the behavior of the this keyword is crucial for writing maintainable and predictable code in JavaScript. It is essential to be aware of how it behaves in different contexts to avoid unexpected results.
	
	(iii) `delete` 
		
		(a) for Objects: removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.

			const Employee = {
			  	firstname: 'John',
			  	lastname: 'Doe',
			};

			console.log(Employee.firstname);
			// Expected output: "John"

			delete Employee.firstname;

			console.log(Employee.firstname);
			// Expected output: undefined

		(b) for Arrays: When you delete an array element, the array length is not affected. This holds even if you delete the last element of the array.

			const trees = ["redwood", "bay", "cedar", "oak", "maple"];
			delete trees[3];
			console.log(3 in trees); // false

	(iv) `in`

		(a) `in` operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain.

			// Arrays
			const trees = ["redwood", "bay", "cedar", "oak", "maple"];
			0 in trees; // returns true
			3 in trees; // returns true
			6 in trees; // returns false
			"bay" in trees; // returns false (you must specify the index number, not the value at that index)
			"length" in trees; // returns true (length is an Array property)
			Symbol.iterator in trees; // returns true

			// Predefined objects
			"PI" in Math; // returns true

			// Custom objects
			const mycar = { make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998 };
			"make" in mycar; // returns true
			"model" in mycar; // returns true
			
	(iv) `throw`

		(a) `throw` keyword in JavaScript is used to explicitly `throw` an exception. It is used within the `try...catch` block to handle and manage exceptions that might occur during the execution of the program. When an error condition arises, the `throw` statement is used to signal that an error has occurred and to stop the execution of the program.

		Here's an example to illustrate the use of the `throw` keyword:

			const divide = (x, y)=>{
			    if (y === 0) {
			        throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed.");
			    }
			    return x / y;
			}

			try {
			    let result = divide(10, 0);
			    console.log("Result:", result);
			} catch (error) {
			    console.error("Error:", error.message);
			}

			in this example, the divide function checks if the divisor `y` is 0. If it is, an Error object is thrown with the message "Division by zero is not allowed." The try...catch block is then used to catch the thrown error, and the error message is logged to the console.

		(b) The throw statement is essential for custom error handling and allows you to create your own error messages, making your code more robust and easier to debug.
		
	(v) Async/Await Keywords

		(a) `async` and `await` are keywords in JavaScript that work together to simplify the process of working with and writing asynchronous code. They make asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, which is easier to read and maintain. These keywords were introduced in ES2017 (ES8) and have since become an integral part of modern JavaScript programming.

		(b) `async` function:

			(I) The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. When a function is declared as `async`, it enables the use of the `await` keyword within the function body.
			(II) An `async` function always returns a promise. If the function explicitly returns a value, the promise will be resolved with that value. If the function throws an error, the promise will be rejected with the thrown error.
			(III) Asynchronous operations within an `async` function can be written in a way that appears synchronous, making the code more readable and easier to understand.

			for Example:-

				async function fetchData() {
				    try {
				        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
				        const data = await response.json();
				        return data;
				    } catch (error) {
				        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
				    }
				}

		(c) `await` Keyword:

			(I) The `await` keyword is used within an async function to pause the execution of the function until the promise is settled.
			(II) When used with a promise, `await` waits for the promise to resolve, and it returns the resolved value. If the promise is rejected, it throws an error that can be caught using a try-catch block.
			(III) It's important to note that `await` can only be used within an async function. Using `await` outside of an async function will result in a syntax error.

			Example of using await within an async function:

				async function fetchUser() {
				    try {
				        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
				        const user = await response.json();
				        console.log(user);
				    } catch (error) {
				        console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
				    }
				}
				
		(d) More Examples:-

			// Example 1: Using async/await with a simple asynchronous function
			async function getData() {
			    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
			    const data = await response.json();
			    return data;
			}

			// Example 2: Using async/await to handle a promise
			function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
			    return new Promise(resolve => {
			        setTimeout(() => {
			            resolve('resolved');
			        }, 2000);
			    });
			}

			async function asyncCall() {
			    console.log('Calling');
			    const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
			    console.log(result);
			}

			// Example 3: Using async/await with error handling
			async function fetchUser() {
			    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
			    if (!response.ok) {
			        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
			    }
			    const user = await response.json();
			    return user;
			}

			In these examples, the async keyword is used to declare functions that can use the await keyword to pause the execution until a promise settles. The code within the async function looks synchronous but is actually asynchronous. It allows you to handle promises more intuitively, making the code easier to read and maintain.

	(vi) `Try`,`Catch` and `finally`

		(a) `try` and `catch` are used for error handling within your code. They allow you to attempt a block of code that might throw an error, and if an error is thrown, you can catch and handle it without interrupting the whole script execution. Here's how they work:

			(I) `try`: This block allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors. If an error occurs within the try block, it gets caught.

			(II) `catch`: This block is used to handle the error. If any error occurs within the try block, it is caught by the catch block, allowing you to handle the error gracefully.

			Here's a basic example to illustrate their usage:

				try {
				    // This is the block of code that will be attempted
				    let result = ThisFunctionThatMayThrowAnError();
				    console.log(result); // If no error is thrown, this will be executed
				} catch (error) {
				    // If an error occurs in the try block, it will be caught here
				    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
				}
				
				In this example, if `ThisFunctionThatMayThrowAnError()` function throws an error, the catch block will handle it, and the error message will be logged to the console. If no error occurs, the catch block is bypassed, and the result is logged normally.

			(III) `try` and `catch` can only catch errors that occur synchronously within the `try` block. Asynchronous errors, such as those inside a setTimeout() or a promise, will not be caught directly by the `try...catch` block and require special handling through promises or other error handling mechanisms.

		(b) `finally` keyword is used in conjunction with `try` and `catch` blocks in error handling. The `finally` block contains statements that will be executed regardless of whether an error is thrown or not. It is typically used to ensure that some code runs no matter what happens in the `try` and `catch` blocks.

			for Example:-

				function divideByTwo(number) {
				    try {
				        if (typeof number !== 'number') {
				            throw 'Input is not a number'; // Throwing a custom error message
				        }
				        return number / 2;
				    } catch (error) {
				        console.error('Error:', error);
				    } finally {
				        console.log('Function execution complete.'); // This will always run
				    }
				}
				
				// Example usage
				divideByTwo('not a number');
				
21. `Promise` Object
		
	(i) The `Promise` object represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It has two main properties: state and result. The state can be either "pending," "fulfilled," or "rejected," and the result is the value that the `Promise` eventually resolves to or the reason for rejection.

	Promises have three states:

	(ii) Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
	(iii) Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
	(iv) Rejected: The operation failed.

	(v) The Promise object takes a function with two parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. The resolve function is called when the operation is successful, and the reject function is called when the operation fails.

	for Example:-

		const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		  	// Simulating an asynchronous operation
		  	setTimeout(() => {
		    	const randomNumber = Math.random();

		    	if (randomNumber > 0.5) {
		      		resolve(randomNumber); // Operation succeeded

		    	} else {
		      		reject(new Error('Operation failed')); // Operation failed
		    	}
		  	}, 1000);
		});
			
		myPromise

		  	.then((result) => {
		    	console.log('The operation was successful. Result:', result);
		  	})
		  	.catch((error) => {
		    	console.error('The operation encountered an error:', error);
		  	});
			
		In this example, `myPromise` simulates an asynchronous operation that either resolves or rejects after a random time interval. The `then()` method is used to handle the successful operation, and the `catch()` method is used to handle any errors or rejections.

	(vi) Key properties of the Promise Object

		(I) State: A Promise has three possible states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a Promise is created, it is in the pending state. When an operation is successful, the Promise transitions to the fulfilled state, and if an error occurs, it transitions to the rejected state.

		(II) Result: The result is the value that the Promise eventually resolves to. When a Promise is fulfilled, it returns a value. If it is rejected, it usually returns an Error object containing the reason for the rejection.

	(vii) Functions of Promise Object

		(a) `.then()`

			(I) `.then()`: It's used to handle the result of a Promise. When a Promise is resolved, the function passed to `.then()` is executed. This function can be used to handle the successful result of the asynchronous operation. It takes in a success callback function as an argument. for Example:-

				someAsyncOperation()
			  	.then((result) => {
			  		console.log('Operation successful: ' + result);
			  	})

		(b) `.catch()`

			(I)`.catch()`: It's used to handle errors in Promises. When a Promise is rejected, the function passed to .catch() is executed. This function can be used to handle any errors that occurred during the asynchronous operation. It takes in an error callback function as an argument. for Example:-

				someAsyncOperation()
			  	.then((result) => {
			  	  	console.log('Operation successful: ' + result);
			  	})
			  	.catch((error) => {
			  	  	console.error('An error occurred: ' + error);
			  	});

		(c) `finally()`
				
			(I) `finally()` Function is used to run some code after the Promise has been settled, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected. This can be useful for cleanup operations that need to be performed no matter what the outcome of the Promise is.

				myPromise.finally(() => {
				  	console.log("Promise finally settled");
				});
			
	(viii) Promise Chaining

		(a) Promise chaining allows you to execute multiple asynchronous operations in a specific sequence. This technique is especially useful when you have dependent asynchronous tasks, where the result of one operation determines the execution of the next. Using `.then()` for promise chaining enables you to handle the fulfillment of a promise and then continue to the next operation based on the result. 
			
			Here is an example to illustrate how to chain promises using `.then()`:

			// A function that returns a promise after a delay
			const delay = (t) => {
				new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, t))
			};

			// Promise chaining with .then()

			delay(2000) // Wait for 2 seconds
			    .then(() => {
			        console.log('2 seconds have passed.');
			        return delay(3000); // Wait for another 3 seconds
			    })
			    .then(() => {
			        console.log('5 seconds have passed in total.');
			        return delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
			    })
			    .then(() => {
			        console.log('6 seconds have passed in total.');
			        // Perform additional operations if necessary
			    });

			(I) In this example, the delay function returns a promise that resolves after a specified duration. By using `.then()` after each promise, you can create a chain of asynchronous operations. Each `.then(II)` block will wait for the previous promise to be fulfilled before executing the next one. This pattern allows you to manage asynchronous tasks in a synchronous manner, making the code easier to read and maintain.

	(ix) Promise API

		(a) `Promise.all()`
				
			(I) `Promise.all()` Functions takes an iterable of Promises as an input and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the input Promises have resolved, or rejects if any of the Promises reject.

			for Example:-

				const promise1 = Promise.resolve("Promise 1 resolved");
				const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
					setTimeout(resolve, 2000, "Promise 2 resolved");
				});

				Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
					.then((values) => {
					    console.log(values);
					})
					.catch((error) => {
						console.error(error);
					});

			(II) `Promise.all()` Returns An array containing values of all the promises

		(b) `Promise.allSettled()`

			(I) `Promise.allSettled()` function is a utility method introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) for handling multiple promises simultaneously. Unlike `Promise.all()`, which immediately rejects upon any of the promises rejecting, `Promise.allSettled()` processes all the promises irrespective of whether they resolve or reject, making it easier to work with multiple asynchronous tasks. It returns a promise that resolves when all the input promises have settled.

				const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
				const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 100, 'Error'));
				const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200, 'Done'));

				Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
					.then((results) => {
						console.log(results)
						// returns an Array
					})

		(c) `Promise.race()`

			(I) `Promise.race()` function is a utility method in JavaScript used to handle multiple promises simultaneously. It takes an iterable of promises as an input and returns a single promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the input promises resolves or rejects. for Example:-

				const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one'));
				const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 100, 'two'));

				Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
				  	.then((value) => {
				    	console.log(value); // "two" is logged, as it is the first one to settle.
				  	})
				  	.catch((reason) => {
				    	// This is never called in this example.
				    	console.log(reason);
				  	});

				In this example, Promise.race() is used to race two promises, and it resolves or rejects with the value or reason of the first promise to settle, respectively.
			
		(d) `Promise.any()`

			(I) `Promise.any()` function in JavaScript is a utility method used to handle multiple promises simultaneously. It takes an iterable of promises as an input and returns a single promise. This promise is fulfilled if any of the promises in the iterable fulfills, and it is rejected only if all of the promises in the iterable are rejected. for Example :-

				const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 100, 'one'));
				const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'two'));

				Promise.any([promise1, promise2])
				  	.then((value) => {
				    	console.log(value); // "two" is logged, as it is the first one to fulfill.
				  	})
				  	.catch((error) => {
				    	console.log(error); // This is never called in this example.
				  	});

				In this example, `Promise.any()` is used to handle two promises. It resolves with the value of the first promise that fulfills, in this case, 'two'. If all the promises are rejected, it would throw an `AggregateError` containing all the rejection reasons.

		(e) `Promise.resolve(value)`: This method returns a `Promise` object that is resolved with the given value. If the value is a thenable (i.e., has a `then()` method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value. for Example:-

			const resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve('Resolved!');
			resolvedPromise.then((value) => {
			  console.log(value); // 'Resolved!' is logged.
			});

		(f) Promise.reject(reason): This method returns a Promise object that is rejected with the given reason. This is mainly used for error handling or indicating that an operation failed. for example:-

			const rejectedPromise = Promise.reject(new Error('Rejected!'));
			rejectedPromise.catch((reason) => {
			  console.error(reason); // 'Rejected!' is logged.
			});
	
22. `Error` Object

	(i) `Error` object in JavaScript represents an error that occurs during the execution of the code. It can be used to create custom error types or handle errors that occur in your code. Instances of the `Error` object can be thrown, caught, and used for structured error handling.

	The Error object has these properties:

	(ii) name: A string representing the name of the error.
	(iii) message: A human-readable description of the error.
	(iv) stack: A string representing the stack trace, which is a list of function calls that were in the execution at the point where the error occurred.

	Here's an example of creating and throwing a custom error using the `Error` object:

		// Custom error example
		try {
		    throw new Error('This is a custom error message');
		} catch (error) {
		    console.error('Error name:', error.name); // Output: Error
		    console.error('Error message:', error.message); // Output: This is a custom error message
		    console.error('Stack trace:', error.stack); // Output: stack trace information
		}

	(v) In this example, we're using the `Error` object to create and throw a custom error. The try...catch block is used to catch the error, and we're logging the properties of the `Error` object to the console.

	(vi) Custom Errors:

		(a) `throw` keyword is used to create custom errors, also known as user-defined or custom exceptions. Custom errors are used to handle specific types of errors that may occur in your code, providing more context and information about the error. Creating custom errors allows you to define your own error types with specific properties and behaviors.

		for Example:-

			function divideByTwo(number) {
			    if (typeof number !== 'number') {
			        throw 'Input is not a number'; // Throwing a custom error message
			    }
			    return number / 2;
			}

			// Example usage
			try {
			    let result = divideByTwo('not a number'); // This will throw the custom error
			    console.log('Result:', result);

			} catch (error) {
			    console.error('Error:', error);
			}

			In this Example, the divideByTwo function checks if the input is a number. If it's not a number, it throws a custom error message. The try...catch block is used to catch the error, and in this case, we simply log the error to the console.
	
23. Network

	(i) Fetch API

		(a) The Fetch API is a modern, versatile interface that provides a way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. It offers a more powerful and flexible feature set compared to its predecessor, XMLHttpRequest. Fetch allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest but with a simpler and more intuitive design. It is built on top of Promises, making it easier to work with, especially when dealing with asynchronous code.

		Here is a detailed explanation of the Fetch API:

		(b) Basic Usage: To make a simple GET request using the Fetch API, you can use the `fetch()` function. This function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.

			fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
			  	.then(response => response.json())
			  	.then(data => console.log(data))
			  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

		(c) Request and Response Objects: Fetch allows you to work with the Request and Response objects, which provide extensive information about the request and response, including headers, status, statusText, and more.
		
		Getting Request:

		(c) Response Object:

			(I) Statuses

				(A) `Status`: The status code of the response (e.g., 200 for a successful request, 404 for a not found request, etc.).
				(B) `Status Text`: The status message corresponding to the status code (e.g., "OK" for 200).
				(C) `ok` Property: A boolean value indicating whether the response was successful (status in the range 200-299) or not.

			(II) Info

				(A) `URL`: The URL of the response.

			(V) Parsing Data

				(Note: Parsing Data is essential to get data in specific Formats)
				
				(A) `text()` Method: Returns a Promise that resolves with the response body as text.
				(B) `json()` function is used to extract JSON content from the response. It parses the response body as JSON and returns a Promise that resolves to the result of parsing the body text as JSON. This function is especially useful when dealing with APIs that return JSON data.
				(C) `Blob()` Method: Returns a Promise that resolves with the response body as a Blob (binary large object).

			(III) Sections

				(A) `Headers`: The headers associated with the response, which include information such as the content type and any custom headers.
				(B) `Body`: The response body, which contains the data received from the server. This can be in the form of text, JSON, or a Blob.

			(IV) Copying Data
				
				(D) `Clone()` Method: Creates a clone of the response object, allowing it to be used again in the code.
					
			for Example:-

				fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
				  	.then(response => {

				    	console.log('Status:', response.status); // Status code
				    	console.log('Status Text:', response.statusText); // Status text
				    	console.log('Headers:', response.headers); // Headers
				    	return response.json(); // Parsing response data as JSON

				  	})
				  	.then(data => console.log(data)) // Handling the JSON response
				  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

			(Note: You always Have to Use `.then()` function twice, One time for Parsing The data and status(status are optional), and the second time actually using it to perform some tasks)

			(XII) Understanding these properties and methods is essential for effectively handling requests and responses in the Fetch API. They provide developers with the necessary tools to work with network requests and process the data returned from the server.

		Posting Request:

		(c) Request Object:

			(I) URL: The URL of the request, represented as a string.
			(II) Method: The HTTP method of the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
			(III) Headers: The headers associated with the request, which include information such as the content type and any custom headers.
			(IV) Body: The request body, which contains the data to be sent to the server. This can include data such as form data or JSON.
			(V) Mode: The mode of the request (e.g., cors, no-cors, same-origin).
			(VI) Credentials: Whether cookies, HTTP authentication, and client-side SSL certificates should be included with the request.
			(VII) Cache: The cache mode of the request (default, reload, no-cache, force-cache, or only-if-cached).
			(VIII) Redirect: The redirect mode of the request (follow, error, or manual).

			for Example:-

				// Creating a new Request object
				const request = new Request('https://api.example.com/data', {
				  	method: 'GET',
				  	headers: new Headers({
				    	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
				  	})
				});

				// Fetching using the created Request object
				fetch(request)
				  	.then(response => response.json())
				  	.then(data => console.log(data))
				  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

		(e) `options` Arguments
			
			(Note: If `options` argument is not defined then the request will simple be a Get Request)
			(I) `options` argument in the fetch API is an optional parameter that allows you to customize the properties of the request, such as the method, headers, body, mode, credentials, cache, redirect, and more. It provides a way to configure various aspects of the HTTP request that you're making. 
			
			Here's a breakdown of some commonly used options:
			
			(II) method (String): The HTTP request method, such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', etc.

				(A) `GET`: This method requests a representation of the specified resource. This method should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.

					fetch('https://example.com/data', {
					  	method: 'GET'
					})
					  	.then(response => response.json())
					  	.then(data => console.log(data))
					  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

				(B) `POST`: This method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

					fetch('https://example.com/data', {
					  	method: 'POST',
					  	headers: {
					    	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
					  	},
					  	body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'John Doe' })
					})
					  	.then(response => response.json())
					  	.then(data => console.log(data))
					  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

				(C) `PUT`: This method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

					fetch('https://example.com/data/123', {
					  	method: 'PUT',
					  	headers: {
					    	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
					  	},
					  	body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Jane Doe' })
					})
					  	.then(response => response.json())
					  	.then(data => console.log(data))
					  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

				(D) `DELETE`: This method deletes the specified resource.

					fetch('https://example.com/data/123', {
					  	method: 'DELETE'
					})
					  	.then(response => response.text())
					  	.then(data => console.log(data))
					  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
					
				(E) `OPTIONS`: This method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.

					fetch('https://example.com/data', {
					  	method: 'OPTIONS'
					})
					  	.then(response => response.text())
					  	.then(data => console.log(data))
					  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
					
				(F) `PATCH`: This method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

					fetch('https://example.com/data/123', {
					  	method: 'PATCH',
					  	headers: {
					    	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
					  	},
					  	body: JSON.stringify({ age: 30 })
					})
					  	.then(response => response.json())
					  	.then(data => console.log(data))
					  	.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

			(III) `headers` object: contains various properties and values that help control the HTTP request `headers`. Here are some of the common properties and their values that can be set within the `headers` object:

				(a) Content-Type: The` Content-Type` header specifies the media type of the resource. It is used to indicate the media type of the resource being sent or requested. Common values include 'application/json', 'text/plain', 'application/xml', etc.

					const headers = new Headers({
					  	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
					});

				(b) `Accept`: The `Accept` header specifies the media types that are acceptable for the response. It indicates the media type that the client is able to understand. Common values include 'application/json', 'text/plain', 'text/html', etc.

					const headers = new Headers({
					  	'Accept': 'application/json'
					});

				(c) `Authorization`: The `Authorization` header is used to provide authentication information, typically in the form of a token or credentials. It allows the client to authenticate itself with the server.

					const headers = new Headers({
					  'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
					});

				(d) `Cache-Control`: The `Cache-Control` header specifies directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses. It controls how and for how long the content should be cached.

					const headers = new Headers({
					  'Cache-Control': 'max-age=3600'
					});

				(e) `User-Agent`: The `User-Agent` header provides information about the user agent originating the request, such as the application type, operating system, and software vendor.
				
					const headers = new Headers({
					  	'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.55 Safari/537.36'
					});

				(f) Custom Headers: You can also set custom headers as needed for your specific application requirements.

					const headers = new Headers({
					  'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value'
					});
			
			(IV) body (Body): The body of the request. This property is used to send data in the request, usually when making a 'POST' or 'PUT' request.

				(A) the `body` object is used to include the `body` content of the HTTP request being sent to the server. The body can contain various types of data, such as JSON, text, Blob, FormData, or URLSearchParams. You can set the body property in the `fetch()` method to send data along with your request. Here are the common ways to use the body property:

				(B) Sending JSON Data: You can send JSON data in the body of a request by stringifying the JSON object and setting it as the value of the `body` property.

					const data = { username: 'example', password: 'example123' };

					const response = fetch(url, {
					  	method: 'POST',
					  	headers: {
					    	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
					  	},
					  	body: JSON.stringify(data)
					});

				(C) Sending Form Data: To send form data, you can use the `FormData` object to collect form fields and their values and then set it as the value of the `body` property.

					const formData = new FormData();
					formData.append('username', 'example');
					formData.append('password', 'example123');

					const response = fetch(url, {
					  	method: 'POST',
					  	body: formData
					});

				(D) Sending Plain Text:	If you want to send plain text, you can directly assign the text to the `body` property. 

					const textData = 'Hello, this is a text message!';
					const response = fetch(url, {
					  	method: 'POST',
					  	headers: {
					    	'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
					  	},
					 	body: textData
					});

				(E) Sending Binary Data: You can send binary data such as images or files using the `Blob` object.	

					const file = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]').files[0];
					const response = fetch(url, {
					  	method: 'POST',
					  	body: file
					});

				(F) The `body` property allows you to customize the data you want to send in the HTTP request. Make sure to set the appropriate `Content-Type` header in the `headers` property to match the type of data you are sending in the body.
			
			(V) mode (RequestMode): This property specifies the mode of the request. It can be 'cors', 'no-cors', 'same-origin', or 'navigate'.
			
			(VI) credentials (RequestCredentials): Determines whether the browser sends cookies with the request. It can be 'same-origin', 'include', or 'omit'.
			
			(VII) cache (RequestCache): This property specifies the cache mode for the request. It can be 'default', 'no-store', 'reload', 'no-cache', 'force-cache', or 'only-if-cached'.
			
			(VIII) redirect (RequestRedirect): Determines how redirects are handled. It can be 'follow', 'error', or 'manual'.
			
			(IX) referrer (String): Specifies the value of the referer HTTP header.
			
			(X) integrity (String): Allows you to specify the Subresource Integrity value of the request.
			
			(XI) window (Object): A reference to the global object. For web browsers, this would be the window object.
			
			(XII) signal (AbortSignal): An AbortSignal object used to communicate with a DOM request. It can be used to abort the request.
			
			(XIII) referrerPolicy (ReferrerPolicy): Specifies the referrer policy for the request.

			Here's an example of using the options argument in a fetch request:

				fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
					  	method: 'POST',
					  	headers: {
					    	'Content-Type': 'application/json',
					    	'Authorization': 'Bearer token123'
					  	},
					  	body: JSON.stringify({
					    	username: 'exampleUser',
					    	password: 'examplePassword'
					  	}),
					  	mode: 'cors',
					  	credentials: 'include',
					  	cache: 'no-cache',
					  	redirect: 'follow',
					  	referrer: 'no-referrer'
					})
					.then(response => response.json())
					.then(data => console.log(data))
					.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
				
			(XI) The options argument is instrumental in tailoring the specifics of your network requests and responses, ensuring you have precise control over how the browser interacts with the remote server.

		(e) Error Handling: Fetch uses Promises, which means you can use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle both successful and failed requests. You can check for errors and handle them appropriately.

		(f) Cross-Origin Requests: Fetch allows you to make cross-origin requests, which is essential when fetching resources from different domains. You can control this behavior using the mode option.

	(ii) Cookies

		(a) Cookies are small pieces of data that can be stored on a user's computer and are often used for tracking, session management, and user preferences.
		(b) `The document.cookie` property allows you to access and manipulate cookies associated with the current webpag

			// Get the value of a specific cookie
			let myCookie = document.cookie;

			// Add a new cookie
			document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2023 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";

		(c) To create a new cookie, you set the `document.cookie` property to a string in the format "name=value". You can also specify additional cookie attributes like expiration date, path, and domain.

			document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2023 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";

		(d) To read a cookie, you parse the `document.cookie` string to find the cookie with the desired name.

			function getCookie(name) {
			  	let cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");
			  	for (let i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
			    	let cookie = cookies[i];
				    let parts = cookie.split("=");
				    if (parts[0] === name) {
			    	  	return decodeURIComponent(parts[1]);
			    	}
			  	}
			  	return null;
			}
			let username = getCookie("username");
			// The getCookie function extracts the value of a specific cookie by name

		(e) To update or delete a cookie, you set the document.cookie property to a new value or remove the cookie by setting its expiration date to the past.

			// Update a cookie's value
			document.cookie = "username=Jane";

			// Delete a cookie by setting its expiration to the past
			document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";

		(f) Cookies are widely used for various purposes, including user authentication, remembering user preferences, and tracking user behavior. However, it's important to be aware of privacy considerations and potential security risks when working with cookies, especially when dealing with sensitive information.

	(iii) `localStorage` property

		(a) The `localStorage` object in JavaScript allows you to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser and it can survive almost everything including reload.
		
		Here are its key properties:

		(b) `localStorage.setItem(key, value)`: This method sets a key-value pair in the `localStorage`. If the key already exists, it will update the value.

			localStorage.setItem('name', 'John');

		(c) `localStorage.getItem(key)`: This method retrieves the value associated with the provided key from the `localStorage`.

			const name = localStorage.getItem('name');
			console.log(name); // Output: John

		(d) `localStorage.removeItem(key)`: This method removes the key-value pair associated with the provided key from the `localStorage`.

			localStorage.removeItem('name');

		(e) `localStorage.key(index)`: This method returns key at a specific index.
			
			localStorage.setItem("name", "James");
			console.log(localStorage.key(0)) // prints: "name"

		(f) `localStorage.clear()`: This method clears all the key-value pairs stored in the `localStorage`.

			localStorage.clear();

		(g) `localStorage.length`: This property returns the number of items stored in the `localStorage`.

			console.log(localStorage.length);

		(h) The `localStorage` object allows you to store data persistently in the user's browser even after the browser is closed. It is a valuable tool for storing user-specific data or settings within a web application. However, be cautious with the amount of data you store, as browsers typically have limits on the amount of data that can be stored using `localStorage`.

		(NOTE: `localStorage` can survive everything even after browser has been closed)

	(iv) `sessionStorage` object
		
		(a) `sessionStorage` object in JavaScript allows you to store key-value pairs for a single session. Data stored in `sessionStorage` persists only for the duration of the page session. When the tab is closed, the data is cleared.
		
		(b) It's properties are exactly the same as `localStorage`s properties so it would be a time waste to explain them again

	(v) Storage Event

		(a) The `storage` event in JavaScript is triggered when changes are made to the `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` objects. These changes can originate from the current window or other windows or tabs running in the same origin. The event allows scripts to track changes to the storage area, enabling real-time synchronization between multiple tabs or windows.

		Here is a basic example of using the `storage` event:


			// Event listener for the 'storage' event
			window.addEventListener('storage', function(event) {
			    if (event.storageArea === sessionStorage) {
			        console.log('sessionStorage key: ' + event.key + ' was changed from ' + event.oldValue + ' to ' + event.newValue + ' in another tab!');
			    } else if (event.storageArea === localStorage) {
			        console.log('localStorage key: ' + event.key + ' was changed from ' + event.oldValue + ' to ' + event.newValue + ' in another tab!');
			    } else {
			        console.log('Some key was changed in another tab!');
			    }
			});

		(b) In the event handler, you can check the `storageArea` property to determine whether the changes were made in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. The `event.key`, `event.oldValue`, and `event.newValue` properties provide information about the changed key, its old value, and its new value, respectively.
			
			Individual Explaination:

			(I) `key`: The name of the key that was changed.
			(II) `oldValue`: The old value of the key before the change.
			(III) `newValue`: The new value of the key after the change.
			(IV) `url`: The URL of the document that initiated the change.
			(V) `storageArea`: Represents either localStorage or sessionStorage object that was affected.
			(VI) `storage`: The Storage object that was affected.
			(VII) `key`: A string that is the named key or index of the property to be set.

		(c) The storage event is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain data consistency across different tabs or windows in a web application. It helps synchronize data in real time, ensuring that any changes made in one tab are reflected in others.

Section: Object Oriented Programming

24. Prototypes

	(i) `__proto__`

		(a) `__proto__` property is a part of the prototype-based inheritance model. Each object in JavaScript has a prototype, which can be accessed using the `__proto__` property. It allows an object to access properties and methods from its prototype. When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it's not found, it then looks at the object's prototype, and continues up the prototype chain until the property or method is found or the end of the chain is reached (which is usually the `Object.prototype`).

		(b) While using `__proto__` is not encouraged for production code due to performance reasons, you can use it for educational purposes or for understanding the underlying prototype chain. Instead of using `__proto__`, it's recommended to use `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()` to get and set the prototype of an object, respectively.

		Here's a simple example of how `__proto__` works:

			// Creating a simple object
			let car = {
			  	make: 'Toyota',
			  	model: 'Corolla'
			};

			// Creating a prototype object
			let vehicle = {
			  	wheels: 4,
			  	color: 'black'
			};

			// Setting the prototype of the car object
			car.__proto__ = vehicle;

			// Accessing properties from the prototype
			console.log(car.color); // 'black'
			console.log(car.wheels); // 4

			In modern JavaScript, you can also use classes and the `extends` keyword for more readable and manageable code when dealing with inheritance and prototypes.

	(ii) `prototype` Object

		(a) `prototype` object is a fundamental concept related to how inheritance is implemented. Every JavaScript object has a `prototype`, which is used for inheritance. The `prototype` can be thought of as a blueprint for the object, defining its properties and methods. When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript first checks if the object itself has that property or method. If it doesn't, it looks at the object's `prototype`, and continues up the `prototype` chain until the property or method is found or the end of the chain is reached.

		(b) The `prototype` property is specific to constructor functions and is not directly accessible on instances of objects. It's used as a template from which other objects are created. When a function is defined in JavaScript, it automatically gets a `prototype` property. This property is where all the properties and methods that should be available to instances of that function are defined.

		Here's an Example:-

			// Creating a constructor function
			function Person(name, age) {
			  	this.name = name;
			  	this.age = age;
			}

			// Adding a method to the prototype of the constructor function
			Person.prototype.introduce = function() {
			  	console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
			};

			// Creating an instance of the Person object
			const person1 = new Person('John', 30);

			// Calling the introduce method
			person1.introduce(); // Hi, my name is John and I am 30 years old.

			In this example, the `prototype` property is used to add a method (`introduce`) to the Person constructor function, making it accessible to all instances created from it.

25. Objects (Revisited)

	(i) `Object` object is a built-in global object that serves as the base for all other objects. It provides various utility functions and properties for creating and manipulating objects.
	
	Here are some of the commonly used properties and methods of the `Object` object, along with examples:
	
	(ii) `Object.assign(target, ...sources)`: This method is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

		const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
		const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

		const mergedObject = Object.assign(target, source);
		console.log(mergedObject); // { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

	(iii)` Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])`: This method creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

		const person = {
		  	isHuman: false,
		  	introduction: ()=>{
		    	console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I human? ${this.isHuman}`);
		  	}
		};

		const me = Object.create(person);
		me.name = 'John';
		me.isHuman = true;

		me.introduction(); // My name is John. Am I human? true

	(iv) `Object.keys(obj)`: This method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

		const car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2020 };
		const keys = Object.keys(car);
		console.log(keys); // ['make', 'model', 'year']

	(v) `Object.values(obj)`: This method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.

		const car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2020 };
		const entries = Object.entries(car);
		console.log(entries); // [['make', 'Toyota'], ['model', 'Corolla'], ['year', 2020]]

	(vi) `Object.entries(obj)`: This method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property [key, value] pairs.

		const car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2020 };
		const entries = Object.entries(car);
		console.log(entries); // [['make', 'Toyota'], ['model', 'Corolla'], ['year', 2020]]

	(vii) `Object.freeze(obj)`: This method freezes an object, preventing new properties from being added to it, existing properties from being removed, or existing properties from being changed.

		const obj = {
		  	property: 42
		};
		
		Object.freeze(obj);
		obj.property = 33; // Throws an error in strict mode
		console.log(obj.property); // 42
		
	(viii) `Object.seal(obj)`: This method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable.

		const obj = {
		  	property: 42
		};

		Object.seal(obj);
		obj.property = 33; // Works fine
		delete obj.property; // Throws an error in strict mode
		console.log(obj.property); // 33
		
	(ix) `Object.is(obj1, obj2)`: This method determines whether two values are the same value. This is similar to the triple equals (`===`) operator, but with a few special cases for `NaN` and `-0`.

		console.log(Object.is('foo', 'foo')); // true
		console.log(Object.is(window, window)); // true

		console.log(Object.is('foo', 'bar')); // false
		console.log(Object.is([], [])); // false

	(x) `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`: This method returns the prototype of the specified object.

		const person = {
		  	name: 'John',
		  	age: 30
		};

		const prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(person);
		console.log(prototype); // {}

26. Classes

	(i) classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) as a syntactical sugar over the prototype-based inheritance model. They provide a more straightforward and clearer way to create objects and deal with inheritance. Under the hood, classes are primarily constructor functions and prototypes. They make it easier to create object blueprints, which can be used to create new instances of objects.

	Here's an example of how classes are used in JavaScript:

		// Defining a simple class
		class Car {
		  	constructor(make, model) {
		    	this.make = make;
		    	this.model = model;
		  	}

		  	// Adding a method to the class
		  	displayInfo() {
		    	console.log(`This is a ${this.make} ${this.model}.`);
		  	}
		}

		// Creating an instance of the class
		const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');

		// Calling the method on the instance
		myCar.displayInfo(); // This is a Toyota Corolla.

		In this example, the `Car` class has a constructor method that is used to initialize object properties, and a `displayInfo` method that is shared among all instances of the `Car` class.

	(ii) `extends` keyword
		
		(a) One of the benefits of using classes is that they allow for easy implementation of inheritance through the `extends` keyword. This enables one class to inherit properties and methods from another. 
		
		for example:-

			// Creating a subclass that extends the Car class
			class ElectricCar extends Car {
			  	constructor(make, model, batteryCapacity) {
			    	super(make, model);
			    	this.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity;
			  	}

			  	// Adding a method to the subclass
			  	displayBatteryCapacity() {
			    	console.log(`This electric car has a battery capacity of ${this.batteryCapacity} kWh.`);
			  	}
			}

			// Creating an instance of the subclass
			const myElectricCar = new ElectricCar('Tesla', 'Model 3', 75);

			// Calling methods from the superclass and subclass
			myElectricCar.displayInfo(); // This is a Tesla Model 3.
			myElectricCar.displayBatteryCapacity(); // This electric car has a battery capacity of 75 kWh.
		
	(iii) Methods:

		(a) `Constructor` Method: The `constructor` method is a special method that is used for creating and initializing an object created with a class. It is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created.

			class Car {
			  	constructor(make, model) {
			    	this.make = make;
			    	this.model = model;
			  	}
			}
			(Note: Constructors always runs whenever the object is called)

		(b) Instance Methods: These are the regular functions defined inside a class. They can be called on instances of the class and can access the instance properties using the `this` keyword.

			class Car {
			  	constructor(make, model) {
			    	this.make = make;
			    	this.model = model;
			  	}

			  	displayInfo() {
			    	console.log(`This is a ${this.make} ${this.model}.`);
			  	}
			}

		(c) `super` keyword is used to access properties on an object literal or class's [[Prototype]], or invoke a superclass's constructor.

			class Rectangle {
			  	constructor(height, width) {
			    	this.name = "Rectangle";
			    	this.height = height;
			    	this.width = width;
			  	}
			  	sayName() {
			    	console.log(`Hi, I am a ${this.name}.`);
			  	}
			  	get area() {
			    	return this.height * this.width;
			  	}
			  	set area(value) {
			    	this._area = value;
			  	}
			}

			class Square extends Rectangle {
			  	constructor(length) {
			    	// Here, it calls the parent class's constructor with lengths
			    	// provided for the Rectangle's width and height
			    	super(length, length);

			    	// Note: In derived classes, super() must be called before you
			    	// can use 'this'. Moving this to the top causes a ReferenceError.
			    	this.name = "Square";
			  	}
			}

		(d) Static Methods: These methods are called on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They are often used for utility functions that are not tied to any specific instance data.

			class Animal{
				constructor(name){
			        this.name = Animal.formatedName(name);
			    }
			    static formatedName(_name){
			    	return _name[0].toUpperCase() + _name.slice(1, _name.length)
			        console.log(this.name)
			    }
			}
			let cat = new Animal("lavender")

			// Output: Lavender

		(e) Getter and Setter Methods: These methods are used to define a property of an object, and they can be used to get or set the value of that property. They provide a way to define custom behavior when an object property is accessed or modified.

			class Car {
			  	constructor(make, model) {
			    	this._make = make;
			    	this._model = model;
			  	}

			  	get make() {
			    	return this._make;
			  	}

			  	set make(newMake) {
			    	this._make = newMake;
			  	}
			}

			// here's Another Example:-

			class ClassWithGetSet {
			  	msg = "hello world";
			  	get msg() {
			    	return this._msg;
			  	}
			  	set msg(x) {
			    	this._msg = `hello ${x}`;
			  	}
			}

			const instance = new ClassWithGetSet();
			console.log(instance.msg); // "hello world"

			instance.msg = "cake";
			console.log(instance.msg); // "hello cake"
			
			(Note: You'll have to put `_` right before name of the properties inside get and set Methods to avoid name collisions which can cause errors)

		(f) `instanceof` keyword checks if 

			Syntax:

				object instanceof constructor

			Example:

				// Creating a Class
				class Car{
					constructor(name, model){
						this.name = name;
						this.model = model;
					}
				}
				
				let NewCar = new Car("name","model")
				console.log(NewCar instanceof Car)  // True
				console.log(NewCar instanceof Car)  // True

			(Note: It'll return true even if the class is Inherited)

27. IIFE

	(i) An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined

	(ii) Syntax:

		(function () {
		  // â€¦
		})();

		(() => {
		  // â€¦
		})();

		(async () => {
		  // â€¦
		})();

	(iii) It is a design pattern which is also known as a `Self-Executing Anonymous Function` and contains two major parts:

		(a) The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator `()`. This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
		(b) The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.

	(iv) Use cases

		(a) Avoid polluting the global namespace
			
			(I) Because our application could include many functions and global variables from different source files, it's important to limit the number of global variables. If we have some initiation code that we don't need to use again, we could use the IIFE pattern. As we will not reuse the code again, using IIFE in this case is better than using a function declaration or a function expression.

				(() => {
				  // some initiation code
				  let firstVariable;
				  let secondVariable;
				})();

				// firstVariable and secondVariable will be deleted after the function is executed.

		(a) Execute an async function
			
			(I) An async IIFE allows you to use await and for-await even in older browsers and JavaScript runtimes that have no top-level await:

				const getFileStream = async (url) => {
				  // implementation
				};

				(async () => {
				  const stream = await getFileStream("https://domain.name/path/file.ext");
				  for await (const chunk of stream) {
				    console.log({ chunk });
				  }
				})();
		
28. Destructuring assignment
	
	(i) The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

		let a, b, rest;
		[a, b] = [10, 20];

		console.log(a);
		// Expected output: 10

		console.log(b);
		// Expected output: 20

		[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

		console.log(rest);
		// Expected output: Array [30, 40, 50]

	(ii) Syntax:

		const [a, b] = array;
		const [a, , b] = array;
		const [a = aDefault, b] = array;
		const [a, b, ...rest] = array;
		const [a, , b, ...rest] = array;
		const [a, b, ...{ pop, push }] = array;
		const [a, b, ...[c, d]] = array;

		const { a, b } = obj;
		const { a: a1, b: b1 } = obj;
		const { a: a1 = aDefault, b = bDefault } = obj;
		const { a, b, ...rest } = obj;
		const { a: a1, b: b1, ...rest } = obj;
		const { [key]: a } = obj;

		let a, b, a1, b1, c, d, rest, pop, push;
		[a, b] = array;
		[a, , b] = array;
		[a = aDefault, b] = array;
		[a, b, ...rest] = array;
		[a, , b, ...rest] = array;
		[a, b, ...{ pop, push }] = array;
		[a, b, ...[c, d]] = array;

		({ a, b } = obj); // parentheses are required
		({ a: a1, b: b1 } = obj);
		({ a: a1 = aDefault, b = bDefault } = obj);
		({ a, b, ...rest } = obj);
		({ a: a1, b: b1, ...rest } = obj);
	
	(iii) Description

		(a) The destructuring assignment uses similar syntax but uses it on the left-hand side of the assignment instead. It defines which values to unpack from the sourced variable.

			const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
			const [y, z] = x;
			console.log(y); // 1
			console.log(z); // 2

		(b) Similarly, you can destructure objects on the left-hand side of the assignment.

			const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
			const { a, b } = obj;
			// is equivalent to:
			// const a = obj.a;
			// const b = obj.b;

	(iv) spread operator (...)
		
		(a) operater allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.

			function sum(x, y, z) {
			  return x + y + z;
			}

			const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

			console.log(sum(...numbers));
			// Expected output: 6
	
29. Scopes

	(i) The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
	
	(ii) JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:

		(a) Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
			
			(I) Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.

		(b) Local scope:

			(I) Function scope: The scope created with a function.

			In addition, variables declared with `let` or `const` can belong to an additional scope (in case if you're wondering `var` keyword belongs to Global Scope):

			(II) Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).
		
	(iii) Scopes in Detail with Examples 
		
		(a) A function creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other functions. For instance, the following is invalid:

			function exampleFunction() {
			  	const x = "declared inside function"; // x can only be used in `exampleFunction`
			  	console.log("Inside function");
			  	console.log(x);
			}

			console.log(x); // Causes error

		(b) However, the following code is valid due to the variable being declared outside the function, making it global:

			const x = "some text";

			function exampleFunction() {
			  	console.log("Inside function");
			  	console.log(x);
			}

			exampleFunction();
			console.log("Outside function");
			console.log(x); // Output: "declared outside function"

		(c) Blocks only scope `let` and `const` declarations, but not `var` declarations.

			{
			  var x = 1;
			}
			console.log(x); // 1

			// on the other hand
			
			{
			  	const x = 1;
			}
			console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

30. Hoisting
	
	(i) JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
	
	(ii) Hoisting is not a term normatively defined in the ECMAScript specification. The spec does define a group of declarations as HoistableDeclaration, but this only includes `function`, `function*`, `async function`, and `async function*` declarations. Hoisting is often considered a feature of `var` declarations as well, although in a different way. In colloquial terms, any of the following behaviors may be regarded as hoisting:

		(a) Being able to use a variable's value in its scope before the line it is declared. ("Value hoisting")
		(b) Being able to reference a variable in its scope before the line it is declared, without throwing a ReferenceError, but the value is always undefined. ("Declaration hoisting")
		(c) The declaration of the variable causes behavior changes in its scope before the line in which it is declared.
		(d) The side effects of a declaration are produced before evaluating the rest of the code that contains it.

	(iii) Some prefer to see `let`, `const`, and `class` as non-hoisting, because the `temporal dead zone` strictly forbids any use of the variable before its declaration. This dissent is fine, since hoisting is not a universally-agreed term. However, the temporal dead zone can cause other observable changes in its scope, which suggests there's some form of hoisting:

		// The following works fine
		const x = 1;
		{
		  console.log(x); // 1
		}
		
		// But
		const y = 1;
		{
		  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
		  const y = 2;
		}

		// Here's another example:
		console.log(a) // output: undefined

		var a = 8;
		console.log(a) // output: 8

		(Note: using `var` for declaration makes the variable declared already by hoisting with the value of `undefined` and it'll stay like that until the line of declaration is reached AKA initialized)

31. Closures

	(i) A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

	(ii) Lexical scoping: Consider the following example code:

		function init() {
		  	var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
		  	function displayName() {
		    	// displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
		    	console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
		  	}
		  	displayName();
		}
		init();

		`init()` creates a local variable called name and a function called `displayName()`. The `displayName()` function is an inner function that is defined inside `init()` and is available only within the body of the `init()` function. Note that the `displayName()` function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, `displayName()` can access the variable name declared in the parent function, `init()`.

	(iii) Scoping with let and const
		
		(a) Traditionally (before ES6), JavaScript only had two kinds of scopes: function scope and global scope. Variables declared with var are either function-scoped or global-scoped, depending on whether they are declared within a function or outside a function. This can be tricky, because blocks with curly braces do not create scopes:

			if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
			  	var x = 1;
			} else {
			  	var x = 2;
			}
			console.log(x);

		(b) In ES6, JavaScript introduced the `let` and `const` declarations, which, among other things like temporal dead zones, allow you to create block-scoped variables.

			if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
			  	const x = 1;
			} else {
			  	const x = 2;
			}
			console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

			In essence, blocks are finally treated as scopes in ES6, but only if you declare variables with let or const. In addition, ES6 introduced modules, which introduced another kind of scope. Closures are able to capture variables in all these scopes, which we will introduce later.

32. Terminal Commands for JS

	(i) `node {directory}` runs code for a specific directory in Node.js Environment 

33. Regular Expressions

	(i) Regular Expressions (regex or regexp) are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. They are used for pattern matching within strings. Regular expressions provide a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as specific characters, words, or patterns of characters. Here are key concepts and components of regular expressions:

	(ii) Syntax

		let RegExpress = /aeiou/ // <-- this is the syntax for Regular Expressions

		let text = "Vowels in English are aeiou";
		
		text = text.replace(RegExpress, "AEIOU")

		console.log(text) // output: Vowels in English are AEIOU

	(iii) Flags
		
		(a) `g` (`g`lobal): Selects Every Match it finds

			let text = "I was is the Kitchen, then I went is the Bedroom";
			let RegExpress = /is/g
			
			text = text.replace(RegExpress, "'in'")
			console.log(text) 
			// Output: I was 'in' the Kitchen, then I went 'in' the Bedroom

		(b) `i` (case `i`nsensitive): selects match even if cases don't match

			let text = "They ARE the same!"
			text = text.replace(/are/gi, "are")
			console.log(text) //Output: They `are` the same

	(iii) Literal Characters: Characters in a regular expression match themselves literally. For example, the regex `abc` would match the string "abc" in a text.

	Advance Pattern Matching:

	(iv) Character classes

		(a) .		any character except newline
		(b) \w\d\s	word, digit, whitespace
		(c) \W\D\S	not word, digit, whitespace
		(d) [abc]	any of a, b, or c
		(e) [^abc]	not a, b, or c
		(f) [a-g]	character between a & g

	(v) Anchors

		(a) ^abc abc$	start / end of the string
		(b) \b\B	word, not-word boundary

	(vi) Escaped characters

		(a) \.\*\\	escaped special characters
		(b) \t\n\r	tab, linefeed, carriage return

	(vii) Groups & Lookaround

		(a) (abc)	capture group
		(b) \1	backreference to group #1
		(c) (?:abc)	non-capturing group
		(d) (?=abc)	positive lookahead
		(e) (?!abc)	negative lookahead

	(viii) Quantifiers & Alternation

		(a) a*a+a?	0 or more, 1 or more, 0 or 1
		(b) a{5}a{2,}	exactly five, two or more
		(c) a{1,3}	between one & three
		(d) a+?a{2,}?	match as few as possible
		(e) ab|cd	match ab or cd

34. How JavaScript Works:

	(i) What is JavaScript?

		(a) JavaScript isa single threaded, non blocking, asynchronous concurrent language
		(b) It has a call stack, an event loop and a callback queue + other APIs
		(c) â€˜V8 is the JavaScript runtime which has a call stack and a heap
		(d) The heap is used for memory allocation and the stack holds the execution context
		(e) DOM, setTimeout, XML HttpRequest donâ€™t exist in V8 source code

	(ii) Stack Call

		function greeting(){
			sayHi();
		}
		function sayHi(){
			return "Hi!";
		}

		greeting();

		(a) When executed (visually):

			(I) `greeting()` function will go into Stack to be executed

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			| 			|   <-- greeting()
			-------------
			 	Stack

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			| greeting()|
			-------------
			 	Stack

			(II) `greeting()` function will callback `sayHi()` function so it'll also be added into stack to be executed

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|	<-- sayHi()
			| greeting()|
			-------------
			 	Stack

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|  sayHi()	|
			| greeting()|
			-------------
			 	Stack

			(III) Once `sayHi()` is Executed all of it's local variables will be deleted and it'll be thrown out of the Stack 

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|  			|	--> sayHi()
			| greeting()|
			-------------
			 	Stack

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|  			|
			| greeting()|
			-------------
			 	Stack

			(IV) `greeting()` will also be thrown out once it's executed completely

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|  			|
			| 			|	--> greeting()
			-------------
			 	Stack

			-------------
			|			|
			|			|
			|			|
			|  			|
			| 			|
			-------------
			 	Stack

			(Note: Stack is Where the Code gets Executed in JavaScript)

	(iii) Asynchronous CallBacks
		
		(a) Sometimes the JavaScript code can take a lot of time and this can block the page re render
		(b) JavaScript has asynchronous callbacks for non blocking behaviour
		(c) JavaScript runtime can do only one thing at a tim
		(d) Browser gives us other things which work along with the runtime like Web APIs.
		(e) In node, these are available as C++ APIs

	(iv) Task Queue

		(a) JavaScript can only do one thing at a time 
		(b) The rest are queued to the task queue waiting to be executed
		(c) When we run `setTimeout`, webAPIs will run a Timer and when it end it pushes the provided function to the stack where it can be executed
		(d) Task Queue is like a lobby waiting to be executed in Stack

	(v) Event Loop

		(a) JavaScript has a runtime based on event loop, which is reponsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks
		(b) The event loop pushes the tasks from the tasks queue to stack
		(c) `setTimeout(()=>{}, 0)` in this code the function inside setTimeout will defer until all the tasks have been executed if you simplify want it to run without delay just don't provide it a second argument.

35. Package Manager

	(i) NPM
	Official Source: "https://www.npmjs.com"

		(a) npm stands for `Node Package Manager`. It is the default package manager for JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. npm is used for managing and sharing JavaScript libraries and tools, making it easier for developers to work on projects, share code, and manage project dependencies.

			Here are some key aspects of npm:

			(I) Package Management: npm allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies (libraries and tools) in their Node.js projects. Packages are typically distributed as modules, and npm simplifies the process of finding, installing, and updating these modules.4

			(II) Command-Line Interface: npm is primarily used through the command line. Developers can use various commands like `npm install`, `npm init`, `npm publish`, etc., to perform tasks such as installing dependencies, initializing a new project, and publishing packages.

			(III) Package.json: Each Node.js project that uses `npm` has a `package.json` file. This file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, description, and most importantly, the list of dependencies required for the project to run. Developers can use the `npm init` command to create a `package.json` file.

			(IV) Scripts: The scripts section in the package.json file allows developers to define custom scripts that can be executed using `npm run`. This is commonly used for automation tasks and running custom commands related to the project.

				Here are some commonly used npm commands:

				(A) `npm install`: Installs dependencies listed in the package.json file.
				(B) `npm install <package-name>`: Installs a specific package and adds it to the package.json file.
				(C) `npm init`: Creates a package.json file interactively.
				(D) `npm publish`: Publishes a package to the npm registry.
				(E) `npm run <script-name>`: Executes a script defined in the scripts section of package.json.
				(F) `npm outdated`: Checks for outdated dependencies.
				(G) `npm update`: Updates packages to their latest versions based on the version constraints specified in package.json.

				Overall, npm is a crucial tool in the JavaScript and Node.js ecosystem, providing a standardized way for developers to manage project dependencies and streamline the development process.

36. Modules

	(i) there are a number of JavaScript libraries and frameworks that enable module usage (for example, other `CommonJS` and AMD-based module systems like `RequireJS`, and more recently Webpack and Babel).

	(ii) Basic example structure
		
		(a) In the following example (see basic-modules) we have a file structure as follows:

			index.html
			main.js
			modules/
			    canvas.js
			    square.js

		(b) The modules directory's two modules are described below:

			(I) canvas.js â€” contains functions related to setting up the canvas:

				(a) `create()`: creates a canvas with a specified width and height inside a wrapper <div> with a specified ID, which is itself appended inside a specified parent element. Returns an object containing the canvas's 2D context and the wrapper's ID.
				(b) `createReportList()`: creates an unordered list appended inside a specified wrapper element, which can be used to output report data into. Returns the list's ID.

			(I) square.js â€” contains:

				(a) `name`: a constant containing the string 'square'.
				(b) `draw()`: draws a square on a specified canvas, with a specified size, position, and color. Returns an object containing the square's size, position, and color.
				(c) `reportArea()`: writes a square's area to a specific report list, given its length.
				(d) `reportPerimeter()`: writes a square's perimeter to a specific report list, given its length.

	(iii) Aside â€” `.mjs` versus `.js` we've used `.js` extensions for our module files, but in other resources you may see the .mjs extension used instead. V8's documentation recommends this, for example. The reasons given are:

		(a) It is good for clarity, i.e. it makes it clear which files are modules, and which are regular JavaScript.
		(b) It ensures that your module files are parsed as a module by runtimes such as Node.js, and build tools such as Babel.

		(c) However, we decided to keep using `.js`, at least for the moment. To get modules to work correctly in a browser, you need to make sure that your server is serving them with a Content-Type header that contains a JavaScript MIME type such as `text/javascript`. If you don't, you'll get a strict MIME type checking error along the lines of "The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type" and the browser won't run your JavaScript. Most servers already set the correct type for `.js` files, but not yet for `.mjs` files. Servers that already serve `.mjs` files correctly include GitHub Pages and http-server for Node.js.

		(d) If you really value the clarity of using `.mjs` for modules versus using `.js` for "normal" JavaScript files, but don't want to run into the problem described above, you could always use `.mjs` during development and convert them to .js during your build step.

	(iv) Exporting module features

		(a) ES6 Method is the easiest way to use it, using `export` & `default` keyword:

			export const name = "square";

			export function draw(ctx, length, x, y, color) {
			  	ctx.fillStyle = color;
				ctx.fillRect(x, y, length, length);

				return { length, x, y, color };
			}

			(I) You can export `functions`, `var`, `let`, `const`, and `classes`. They need to be top-level items; you can't use export inside a function, for example.
			(II) A more convenient way of exporting all the items you want to export is to use a single export statement at the end of your module file, followed by a comma-separated list of the features you want to export wrapped in curly braces. For example:

				export { name, draw, reportArea, reportPerimeter };

			(III) `default` keyword let's you export `functions`, `var`, `let`, `const`, and `classes` retrieve it without destructuring

				export default name;

		(b) Common.JS Module export when uses: `WebAssembly.Module.exports()`: which returns an array containing descriptions of all the declared exports. or you can assign it a value and it'll export them!.
			
			for example:-

				const sayHello = (name)=>{
					console.log(`hello ${name}!`)
				}
				const sayGoodMorning = (name)=>{
					console.log(`good morning ${name}!`)
				}
				WebAssembly.Module.exports = {sayHello, sayGoodMorning};

			This above code is same as:

				export const sayHello = (name)=>{
					console.log(`hello ${name}!`)
				}
				export const sayGoodMorning = (name)=>{
					console.log(`good morning ${name}!`)
				}
		
	(v) Importing module features into your script
		
		(a) ES6 Method is (Again) the easiest way to use it, using `import` and `from` keyword:

			import { name, draw, reportArea, reportPerimeter } from "./modules/square.js";

			// If you've used `default` keyword

			import name {draw, reportArea, reportPerimeter } from "./modules/square.js";
			
			(I) use the `import` statement, followed by a comma-separated list of the features you want to import wrapped in curly braces, followed by the keyword `from`, followed by the module specifier.

			(II) The module specifier provides a string that the JavaScript environment can resolve to a path to the module file. In a browser, this could be a path relative to the site root, which for our basic-modules example would be `/js-examples/module-examples/basic-modules`. However, here we are instead using the dot (`.`) syntax to mean "the current location", followed by the relative path to the file we are trying to find. This is much better than writing out the entire absolute path each time, as relative paths are shorter and make the URL portable â€” the example will still work if you move it to a different location in the site hierarchy.  for example:

				`C:/Users/Admin/Documents/project/examples/modules/square.js` becomes `./modules/square.js`

		(b) Common.JS Module import uses `require()`function, which allows you to load and used external modules (pieces of code) in a Node.js application

			(I) Loading Modules: When you use `require()`, you provide the path to the module you want to load. This can be a relative path to a local file or the name of a module installed via npm.

				(A) Example for loading a local file:

					const myModule = require('./myModule');

				(B) Example for loading an npm module:

					const express = require('express');
			
			(II) Path Resolution:

				(A) If the path provided to `require()` is a local file, Node.js resolves the path based on the current file's location. Relative paths (`./`, `../`) are resolved relative to the current file.
				(B) If the path is a module name (like 'express'), Node.js looks for the module in the `node_modules` folder in the current directory and its parent directories.

	(vi) Once you've imported the features into your script, you can use them just like they were defined inside the same file. The following is found in main.js, below the import lines:

		const myCanvas = create("myCanvas", document.body, 480, 320);
		const reportList = createReportList(myCanvas.id);

		const square1 = draw(myCanvas.ctx, 50, 50, 100, "blue");
		reportArea(square1.length, reportList);
		reportPerimeter(square1.length, reportList);

37. Built in Modules

	(i) `HTTP Module`:

		(a) http module in Node.js is a core module that provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and making HTTP requests. This module allows you to build both server-side and client-side components for handling HTTP communication.

		(b) HTTP Server with http Module:

			(Note: It's recommended to make a server with `express.js`)

			(I) Creating an HTTP Server:

				(A) You can create an HTTP server using the `http.createServer()` method. This method takes a callback function that is executed for each incoming HTTP request.

				const http = require('http');
				const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
				    // Request handling logic here
				    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
				    res.end('Hello, World!\n');
				});
				const port = 3000;
				server.listen(port, () => {
				    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
				});

				(B) Handling Incoming Requests: The callback function passed to `createServer` takes two parameters: `req` (the request object) and `res` (the response object). You handle incoming requests and send responses within this function.

		(c) HTTP Client with http Module:
			
			(I) Making HTTP Requests: 
				
				(A) The http module can be used to make HTTP requests. The `http.request()` method is commonly used for this purpose.

					const http = require('http');

					const options = {
					    hostname: 'www.example.com',
					    port: 80,
					    path: '/',
					    method: 'GET',
					};

					const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
					    let data = '';

					    // A chunk of data has been received.
					    res.on('data', (chunk) => {
					        data += chunk;
					    });

					    // The whole response has been received.
					    res.on('end', () => {
					        console.log(data);
					    });
					});

					req.end(); // Important: Close the request stream.

				(B) Handling Responses: Similar to the server side, you handle responses by listening for events on the response object (`res`).

		Key Concepts:
		
		(d) Request Object (req): Represents the HTTP request and contains information about the incoming request, such as headers and URL.
		
		(e) Response Object (res): Represents the HTTP response that will be sent back to the client. You use methods like `res.writeHead()` and `res.end()` to send the response.
		
		(f) Event Emitters: Both the `req` and `res` objects are event emitters. You can listen for events like 'data', 'end', and others to handle the flow of data.
		
		(g) Options Object: When making HTTP requests, an options object is often used to specify details such as the hostname, port, path, and request method.
		
		(h) Status Codes: HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found) are used in the `res.writeHead` method to communicate the status of the response.

	(ii) `File System Module`:
	
		(a)  The File System module in Node.js, often referred to as the `fs` module, provides an interface for interacting with the file system. It allows you to perform various file-related operations, such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting directories, and more.

		(b) Reading from a File:
			
			(I) `fs.readFile()` and `fs.readFileSync()`: These methods are used to read the contents of a file asynchronously and synchronously, respectively.

			const fs = require('fs');

			// Asynchronous read
			fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
			    if (err) throw err;
			    console.log(data);
			});

			// Synchronous read
			const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
			console.log(data);

		(c) Writing to a File: 
			
			(I) `fs.writeFile()` and `fs.writeFileSync()`: These methods are used to write data to a file asynchronously and synchronously, respectively.

			const fs = require('fs');

			const content = 'Hello, World!';

			// Asynchronous write
			fs.writeFile('example.txt', content, 'utf8', (err) => {
			    if (err) throw err;
			    console.log('File written successfully.');
			});

			// Synchronous write
			fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', content, 'utf8');
			console.log('File written successfully.');

		(d) File Information:
			
			(I) `fs.stat()`: This method is used to get information about a file, such as its size, timestamps, and more.

			const fs = require('fs');

			fs.stat('example.txt', (err, stats) => {
			    if (err) throw err;
			    console.log('File size:', stats.size, 'bytes');
			    console.log('Last modified:', stats.mtime);
			});

		(e) Directory Operations: 
			
			(I) `fs.mkdir()` and `fs.rmdir()`: These methods create and remove directories, respectively.

			const fs = require('fs');

			// Create a directory
			fs.mkdir('new_directory', (err) => {
			    if (err) throw err;
			    console.log('Directory created successfully.');
			});
			
			// Remove a directory
			fs.rmdir('old_directory', (err) => {
			    if (err) throw err;
			    console.log('Directory removed successfully.');
			});

		(f) Renaming and Deleting Files:
			
			(I) `fs.rename()` and `fs.unlink()`: These methods are used to rename and delete files, respectively.

				const fs = require('fs');

				// Rename a file
				fs.rename('old_file.txt', 'new_file.txt', (err) => {
				    if (err) throw err;
				    console.log('File renamed successfully.');
				});
				
				// Delete a file
				fs.unlink('file_to_delete.txt', (err) => {
				    if (err) throw err;
				    console.log('File deleted successfully.');
				});


	(iii) `Path Module`:
	
		(a) The path module helps in creating and manipulating file paths in a way that is platform-agnostic, meaning it works consistently across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).

		Here are some common functions provided by the path module:

		(b) `path.join([...paths])`: This method joins all the given path segments together. The resulting path is normalized, and any '..' or '.' segments are resolved.

			const path = require('path');

			const fullPath = path.join('/foo', 'bar', 'baz/asdf', 'quux', '..');
			console.log(fullPath);
			// Output on Unix-like systems: '/foo/bar/baz/asdf'
			// Output on Windows: '\foo\bar\baz\asdf'

		(c) `path.resolve([...paths])`: Resolves the specified paths into an absolute path. It behaves similarly to `path.join()`, but it also resolves any relative paths based on the current working directory.

			const fullPath = path.resolve('path', 'to', 'file.txt');
			console.log(fullPath);
			// Output on Unix-like systems: '/current/working/directory/path/to/file.txt'
			// Output on Windows: 'C:\current\working\directory\path\to\file.txt'

		(d) `path.basename(path[, ext])`: Returns the last portion of a path, similar to the Unix `basename` command. Optionally, you can provide an extension, and the base name will be without that extension.

			const fileName = path.basename('/path/to/file.txt');
			console.log(fileName); // Output: 'file.txt'
			
			const baseNameWithoutExt = path.basename('/path/to/file.txt', '.txt');
			console.log(baseNameWithoutExt); // Output: 'file'

		(e) `path.dirname(path)`: Returns the directory name of a path.

			const dirName = path.dirname('/path/to/file.txt');
			console.log(dirName);
			// Output on Unix-like systems: '/path/to'
			// Output on Windows: '\path\to'

		(f) `path.extname(path)`: Returns the extension of the path, including the period (`.`).

			const extension = path.extname('/path/to/file.txt');
			console.log(extension); // Output: '.txt'

		(g) `path.normalize(path)`: Normalizes the given path, resolving '..' and '.' segments. It simplifies the path and makes it more consistent.

			const normalizedPath = path.normalize('/foo/bar//baz/asdf/quux/..');
			console.log(normalizedPath);
			// Output on Unix-like systems: '/foo/bar/baz/asdf'
			// Output on Windows: '\foo\bar\baz\asdf'

		(h) `path.isAbsolute(path)`: Determines if the given path is an absolute path.

			console.log(path.isAbsolute('/foo/bar')); // Output: true
			console.log(path.isAbsolute('foo/bar'));  // Output: false

		(i) `path.relative(from, to)`: Returns the relative path from the from path to the to path.

			const relativePath = path.relative('/data', '/data/file.txt');
			console.log(relativePath); // Output: 'file.txt'

		(j) `path.parse(pathString)`: Returns an object from a path string, providing information about the path.

			const pathInfo = path.parse('/path/to/file.txt');
			console.log(pathInfo);
			/* Output:
			{
			  	root: '/',
			  	dir: '/path/to',
			  	base: 'file.txt',
			  	ext: '.txt',
			  	name: 'file'
			}
			*/

		(k) `path.sep` and `path.delimiter`: These properties provide the platform-specific path segment separator (`/` on Unix-like systems, `\` on Windows) and the platform-specific path delimiter for PATH environment variable (: on Unix-like systems, ; on Windows), respectively.

			console.log(path.sep);       // Output: '/' on Unix-like systems, '\' on Windows
			console.log(path.delimiter); // Output: ':' on Unix-like systems, ';' on Windows
		
		Variables:
		
		(l) `__dirname` represents the current directory that the file is stored in

			console.log(path.join(__dirname))
			// C:/users/documents/project

		(m) `__filename` represents the current file

			console.log(path.join(__filename))
			// index.js
